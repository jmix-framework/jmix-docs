= Email Sending API

== Sending Methods

To send emails, use the following methods of the `Emailer` bean:

* `sendEmail()` – synchronous message sending. The calling code is blocked while sending the message to the SMTP server. You can specify the message either by a set of parameters – the comma-separated list of recipients, subject, content, an array of attachments; or as a special `EmailInfo` object which encapsulates all this information and allows you to explicitly set the sender’s address.
+
Here is an example of sending email using `EmailInfo` object:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/email/ex1/screen/newsitem/NewsItemEdit.java[tags=emailer;email-info1;email-info2]
----
+
During synchronous sending, the framework can throw `EmailException` with the information about failed recipient addresses and corresponding error messages.
+
One `SendingMessage` instance is created in the database for all recipients during the execution of the method. It has the initial `SendingStatus.SENDING` status, and `SendingStatus.SENT` after successful sending. In case of a message sending error, the message status changes to `SendingStatus.NOT_SENT`.
+
* `sendEmailAsync()` – asynchronous message sending. This method returns `SendingMessage` instance in `SendingStatus.QUEUE` status, which was created in the database. The actual sending is performed later by the `Emailer.processQueuedEmails()` method which should be called by a xref:configuration.adoc#email-sending-scheduler[scheduler].

== Email Attachments

The `EmailAttachment` object is a wrapper that holds the attachment as a byte array, a file name, and, if necessary, an attachment identifier which is unique for this message. 

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/email/ex1/screen/newsitem/NewsItemEdit.java[tags=create-attachment]
----

The attachment identifier is an optional but useful field when you want to insert images in the message body. For this, specify a unique `contentId` when creating `EmailAttachment`, as `logoId` in the example above. To insert the image in the message body, use an expression like `cid:logoId` as a path to attachment, for example:

[source,html]
----
<img src="cid:logoId"/>
----

Also, you can create a text attachment from the string and specify an encoding and the name of the attachment file. In the example, an attachment is created and sent with email:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/email/ex1/screen/newsitem/NewsItemEdit.java[tags=text-attachment]
----
