= Obtaining Tokens

The way the client obtains an access token for accessing a protected resource is called an authorization grant. The authorization server add-on supports grant types that are described in the OAuth 2.1 specification (and enabled in the Spring Authorization Server framework). Additionally, the Jmix Authorization Server add-on adds the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.3[Resource Owner Password Credentials] grant type, that existed in OAuth 2.0 specification but was removed in OAuth 2.1.

The list of supported grant types looks as follows:

* Client credentials
* Authorization code
* Resource Owner Password Credentials
* Refresh Token

[[client-credentials-grant]]
== Client Credentials Grant

The {oauth-specification-page}#name-client-credentials-grant[Client Credentials grant^] enables getting access tokens from the authorization server by providing registered client credentials in the request.

TIP: Use the Client Credentials grant for machine-to-machine applications where no user interaction is involved.

The idea is the following:

* The client with id and secret is registered in Jmix application.
* Jmix resource and row-level roles are assigned to the client.
* Client application uses client id and secret to obtain access token by a special HTTP request.
* Using this token the client application can access protected API endpoints with permissions included to the roles assigned to the client.

The simplest way to register a client is to add standard Spring Authorization Server application properties:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/authserver-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=my-client-registration]
----

The next set of application properties is Jmix-specific and defines which resource and row-level roles must be assigned to the access token issued to the client. In this example we will assign two resource roles:

* `rest-minimal` (REST: minimal access) - to enable REST API endpoints access.
* `user-management` (User management) - to allow operations with the User entity using REST API.

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/authserver-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=my-client-role-assignment]
----

The `user-management` role looks as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/authserver-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/security/UserManagementRole.java[tags=user-management-role]
----
<1> The API scope indicates the role will be applied for REST API requests

After these properties are defined in the application it should be possible to obtain access tokens. In this example, we will use the `curl` command-line tool to interact with the REST API.

[source, bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token \
   --basic --user my-client:my-secret \
   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
   -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
----

TIP: On Windows, remove `\` symbols and write the command in a single line.

As a result, you should get something like this:

.HTTP/1.1 200
[source, json]
----
{
  "access_token":"hKhgNyGMTqaKd6prH-GoHF8zFVTSr9tKKyE3OnMoafRO4FT4Xq_cewHr28cIRITaRmF0olRXpVTyFdxcOPTAl8Vc7xopHrdNuXNXwEeBn7NSiEMvQXW5zO0dwMn_H8FQ",
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":299
}
----

The `access_token` attribute is the token you can use for further requests as part of the `Authorization` Header. It acts as a temporary credential that grants you access to the application.


Alternatively to specifying client properties in the `application.properties` file, clients may be registered by providing a `RegisteredClientRepository` bean. See {spring-authorization-server-docs}/core-model-components.html#registered-client-repository[Spring Authorization Server documentation^] for details.

NOTE: If you create a `RegisteredClientRepository` then `application.properties` won't be analyzed.

[[authorization-code-grant]]
== Authorization Code Grant

You can read about the Authorization Code grant in the {oauth-specification-page}#name-authorization-code-grant[OAuth 2.1 specification^].

This flow allows you to obtain an access token with permissions of a real Jmix application user. You deal with the Authorization Code grant when you authorize using Google or Facebook on any website. A special login form is displayed by Jmix application, Jmix app validates credentials and if they are valid the access token is issued by a series of HTTP requests between the client application and Jmix application. The benefit of this grant is that the client application never deals with user credentials.

TIP: Use the Authorization Code grant for modern web and mobile applications where security is a priority and where redirect-based flows are possible.

In order to enable the grant type in Jmix application you need to define a client that supports this grant type.

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/authserver-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=myapp-client-registration]
----

Keep in mind that by default Spring Authorization server configures the following endpoint URLs:

* authorization endpoint: `/oauth2/authorize`, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize`
* token endpoint: `/oauth2/token`, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token`

In this example we will use the https://oauthdebugger.com[^] site for token issuing testing. It will emulate an external application that requires access to Jmix resources and that needs to obtain an access token. In your own application you will need to implement steps described in the OAuth 2.1 protocol specification: send a request to the authorization endpoint, handle the redirect, extract the authorization code from it, make a request for the token endpoint to exchange the authorization code for the access token, etc.

Open https://oauthdebugger.com[^]. Fill in the fields:

* *Authorize URI*: ++http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize++
* *Client ID*: myapp
* *Scope*: leave this field empty
* *Use PKCE?*: enable the checkbox

image::oauthdebugger-website.png[align="center"]

Remember the value of the Code Verifier field. We will need it later.

Click the *SEND REQUEST* button on the bottom of the page.

You should see a special login form provided by Jmix application where you should enter credentials of existing Jmix user.

image::authserver-login-form.png[align="center"]

The access token you will get later as a result of all steps will be associated with this user and all requests to Jmix REST API will consider this user permissions (resource roles and row-level roles).

If credentials are valid, you should be redirected to the Redirect URI https://oauthdebugger.com/debug[^] that was defined in `application.properties`. Authorization code must be added as a `code` URL parameter, e.g. `++https://oauthdebugger.com/debug?code=BdgQArzTaj_xna_a0-PoUIQwszMR0xPkToxcktd5wPe4SbO18qBYStqJePOPNaoe9cuIJe0nac0cw0yVC9Iv3SeofEYbMZhMKldoJQQwcBUnBTfp2AyQayDlaE8KPaCf&state=sujodv3j7eh++`

To exchange this authorization code for access token you need to execute another HTTP request to the token endpoint of Jmix application. We will use the `curl` command line tools for this. Use the `code_verifier` value from the initial page of the https://oauthdebugger.com[^].

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token \
   --basic --user myapp:myappsecret \
   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
   -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
   -d "redirect_uri=https://oauthdebugger.com/debug" \
   -d "code=c9ehHTJyT84mX-v2v2Q8sbAxkAFYg-gjfZDJImu5ExZVGLUyWn_J2-afs_m7kiv7MwjD-XXVRQtwz_6H-JTb4NvuWiUw6-5vrF75LtyNYAovuvSJQ680nQwv3PbhB4Y-" \
   -d "code_verifier=zdhRZIStXgwonFfvNYo2oI6nYuYt022LdcZF8eh3LGE" \
   -d "code_challenge_method=S256"
----

As a result, you should get something like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "access_token":"Q6zvq8qGMUrN1VgouerOp4TJrry2f8oqL6mix8lDW-VKD_JHZXx0xv-ZZ_Zg_qgaHNw_wmeX6Qs0SlvEiFCyHqJ-PjqsnNkfF1XNKCAV43GQO0QeqmuV2sMiLgzY-m5r",

  "expires_in":299
}

[[custom-login-form]]
=== Custom Login Form

This section contains an example of replacing the standard login form provided by the Authorization Server add-on with a custom one.

First, create a login form template. The Authorization Server add-on includes the https://www.thymeleaf.org[Thymeleaf^] template engine as a dependency, so you can use it for your own login form.

Create a new file named `my-as-login.html` and place it in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory. This is a default location where Thymeleaf will search for templates.

.my-as-login.html
[source,html]
----
include::example$/authserver-ex1/src/main/resources/templates/my-as-login.html[]
----

You may notice that the form uses styles and an image located at the `+/my-as-login/styles/**+` and `+/my-as-login/icons/**+` paths, respectively.

Download the compiled https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/[Bootstrap^] CSS files and copy the `bootstrap.min.css` file into the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/my-as-login/styles` directory.

NOTE: `META-INF/resources` is one of the default places where Spring searches for static resources.

Create the `as-login.css` file in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/my-as-login/styles` directory:

.as-login.css
[source,css]
----
include::example$/authserver-ex1/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/my-as-login/styles/as-login.css[]
----

Take any icon (e.g., Jmix logo), rename it to `as-login-icon.png` and place it in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/my-as-login/icons` directory.

Next, you need to instruct Spring Security to allow access to files with styles and images. Create a Spring configuration that permits access to URLs where login form resources are located.

.MySecurityConfiguration.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$/authserver-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/config/MySecurityConfiguration.java[tags=whole-class]
----
<1> This bean must have a higher precedence than the security filter chain from the `FlowuiSecurityConfiguration`.

Finally, instruct the application that the new login form must be used instead of the one provided by the Authorization Server add-on using the following application property:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::example$/authserver-ex1/src/main/resources/application-custom-login-form.properties[tags=login-page-view-name]
----

After completing all the above steps, your authorization server login page should look similar to this one:

image::custom-login-form.png[align="center"]

[[resource-owner-password-credentials-grant]]
== Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

The Resource Owner Password Credentials grant has been removed from the OAuth 2.1 specification as it is not secure enough (user credentials should be entered directly in the client application). However, it can be useful in some cases, so Jmix framework provides support for it. You can read more about the Resource Owner Password Credentials grant in the {oauth-2_0-specification-page}#section-4.3[OAuth 2.0 specification^].

In short, this flow allows you to obtain an access token with permissions of a real Jmix application user. Jmix user credentials are passed in the request body.

TIP: Use the Resource Owner Password Credentials grant in trusted, legacy, or highly controlled environments where you have no other practical choice.

To enable this flow, the "password" grant type must be registered for the client in the `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
include::example$/authserver-ex1/src/main/resources/application-password-grant.properties[tags=authorization-grant-types]
----

A full set of application properties may be as follows:

[source,properties]
----
include::example$/authserver-ex1/src/main/resources/application-password-grant.properties[tags=password-grant-all-props]
----

To obtain an access token, the client must make a request to the token endpoint. The request content type must be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. The `grant_type` parameter should have the `password` value. `username` and `password` parameters must contain Jmix user credentials. The `Authorization` header must define the basic authentication using client id and secret registered in `application.properties`. In the example above they are `myapp` and `mysecret`.

The request using the `curl` utility will look as follows:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token \
   --basic --user myapp:mysecret \
   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
   -d "grant_type=password" \
   -d "username=user1" \
   -d "password=pass1"
----

The following result will be returned:

[source,json]
----
{
  "access_token":"Q6zvq8qGMUrN1VgouerOp4TJrry2f8oqL6mix8lDW-VKD_JHZXx0xv-ZZ_Zg_qgaHNw_wmeX6Qs0SlvEiFCyHqJ-PjqsnNkfF1XNKCAV43GQO0QeqmuV2sMiLgzY-m5r",
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":3599
}
----

If you need a refresh token to be returned as well, then register the "refresh_token" grant for the client:

[source,properties]
----
spring.security.oauth2.authorizationserver.client.myclient.registration.authorization-grant-types=password,refresh_token
----


[[refresh-token-grant]]
== Refresh Token Grant

You can read about Refresh Token grant in {oauth-specification-page}#name-refresh-token-grant[OAuth 2.1 specification^].

TIP: Use the Refresh Token grant to obtain a new access token using existing refresh token without requiring user interaction.

The `refresh_token` grant type should be registered for the client:

[source,properties]
----
include::example$/authserver-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=myapp-client-registration-authorization-grant-type]
----

To exchange the refresh token for a new access token you need to execute HTTP request to the token endpoint of Jmix application. We will use the `curl` command line tools for this.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token \
   --basic --user myapp:myappsecret \
   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
   -d "grant_type=refresh_token" \
   -d "refresh_token=zN2i5JooLfi0iqNJzaE-iiEiC2oHStv_X-kOaLuqX6ZNyRCs0EaNLik1xZrz-TPHfNEahLS2c402S_1kAO09K2x6oi3LFgpFoyr9snwE3ZXJ3Lp5AVH7s4YUBOXi0VRc"
