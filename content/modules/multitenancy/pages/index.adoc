= Multitenancy

The add-on allows you to build multitenant Jmix applications where data from multiple tenants is stored in a single database. A single instance of the application can cater to multiple tenants, defined as groups of users who are isolated from each other and have access only to specific (often read-only) data.

In a multitenant Jmix application, there are two main categories of data:

* *Common Data*:
** Data that is shared among all tenants in the application.
** Tenants have read-only access to this common data, which is universally accessible but cannot be modified by individual tenants.

* *Tenant-Specific Data*:
** Data specific to each tenant and not visible or accessible to other tenants.
** Tenants have full access to their own tenant-specific data, allowing them to interact with and modify this data as needed without affecting data belonging to other tenants.

By implementing multitenancy in Jmix applications, developers can efficiently manage and deliver services to multiple clients or user groups, ensuring data isolation, security, and personalized access controls based on the specific needs of each tenant. This approach optimizes data organization and access while maintaining data privacy and integrity across different user groups.

CAUTION: The xref:rest:index.adoc[] add-on does not fully support multitenancy. It doesn't separate entity instances by tenants.

[[installation]]
== Installation

For automatic installation through Jmix Marketplace, follow instructions in the xref:ROOT:add-ons.adoc#installation[Add-ons] section.

For manual installation, add the following dependencies to your `build.gradle`:

[[how-it-works]]
== How it Works

In your project, tenant-specific entities should include a String attribute annotated with `@TenantId`. When a tenant user loads these entities, the framework applies a `WHERE` condition based on the tenant-id attribute to the JPQL query to fetch only the data relevant to the user’s tenant. Additionally, the tenant-id attribute gets automatically assigned to the current user's tenant when saving new entities.

CAUTION: There is no automatic filtering for native SQL, so tenant users should not have access to any functionality that provides access to native SQL or Groovy code (xref:jmx-console:index.adoc[JMX Console], creating xref:reports:index.adoc[reports], etc.).

In your project, the `User` entity should include a tenant-id attribute. This attribute must be assigned a specific value for all tenant users. Users without a value in this attribute (those not linked to any specific tenant) can access data from all tenants. This setup is suitable for __global administrators__ who are responsible for configuring tenants and overseeing the entire system.

The following entities of Jmix modules have `sysTenantId` attribute and support multitenancy:

* `EntityLogItem`
* `SendingMessage`
* `SendingAttachment`
* `Report`
* `ReportGroup`
* `ResourceRoleEntity`
* `RowLevelRoleEntity`
* `FilterConfiguration`

[[managing-tenants]]
== Managing Tenants

The add-on provides the *Multitenancy -> Tenants* view that enables global administrators to create and modify tenants.

The tenant registration entity has two attributes:

* *Tenant id* - an identifier utilized in tenant-specific entities. It cannot be changed after creation.
* *Tenant name* - a descriptive name of the tenant.

[[tenant-users]]
== Tenant Users

In multitenant applications, users within different tenants can have the same login names. To ensure that each `username` attribute is unique across the entire application, tenant users should register with a username that includes tenant-id prefix. For instance, if there are two different users named Alice in `t1` and `t2` tenants, their usernames should be `t1|alice` and `t2|alice`, respectively.

Tenant users can log in to the application by providing the complete username, including the tenant-id, such as `t1|alice`.

There are two ways to log in tenant users to the application:

. The first way is to use a URL parameter that includes the tenant-id when accessing the login screen, for example `++http://localhost:8080/login?tenantId=t1++`. In this case, users can simply enter their login name without the tenant-id prefix, like just `alice`.
+
You also have the option to set a custom name for the URL parameter by using the `jmix.multitenancy.tenantIdUrlParamName application` application property.

. Users can provide the full username including the tenant-id, for example `t1|alice`.

NOTE: You can implement your own scheme of unique usernames instead of the method described above.

[[configuring-users]]
== Configuring Users

In this section, we will explain the process of setting up user management and authentication in your project to support multitenancy.

. Add a string attribute to your `User` entity and annotate it with the `@TenantId` annotation:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/multitenancy-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/entity/User.java[tags=tenantId]
----

. Implement the `io.jmix.multitenancy.core.AcceptsTenant` interface in the `User` entity. The `getTenantId()` method must return the attribute marked with `@TenantId` annotation:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/multitenancy-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/entity/User.java[tags=user;getTenantId]
----

. Add the `tenant` column to the data grid in `user-list-view.xml`:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/multitenancy-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=tenant]
----

. Add field for selecting tenant in `user-detail-view.xml`:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/multitenancy-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/user/user-detail-view.xml[tags=tenant]
----

. Add the following to the `UserDetailView` class:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/multitenancy-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/user/UserDetailView.java[tags=tenantField;tenant]
----

. To enable the usage of identical login names across various tenants as <<tenant-users,previously explained>>, include the following code snippet in your `LoginView` class:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/multitenancy-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/login/LoginView.java[tags=tenant]
----
<1> Use the `com.vaadin.flow.router.Location` object to work with the current URL.

[[configuring-security]]
== Configuring Security

When setting up roles for tenant users, do not include the tenant-id attributes in entity attribute policies to hide them from users. For instance, if the `Customer` entity is specific to a certain tenant and includes a `tenant` attribute annotated with `@TenantId`, the role granting access to this entity should explicitly specify the attributes and exclude the `tenant` attribute:

[source,java,indent=0]
