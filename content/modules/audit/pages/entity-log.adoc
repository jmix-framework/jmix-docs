= Entity Log

Entity Log is a mechanism for tracking changes in your JPA entities. It records changes in entity attributes and provides a user interface for searching and displaying information about the changes:

* What entity instance was changed.
* Old and new values of changed attributes.
* When the entity was changed.
* Which user changed the entity.

== Registering Changes

Entity Log automatically tracks changes of JPA entities when they are saved using xref:data-access:data-manager.adoc[DataManager] or xref:data-access:entity-manager.adoc[EntityManager]. It doesn't work if you use native SQL.

You can also use the `EntityLog` bean to register changed entities from your application code. In this case, invoke `registerCreate()`, `registerModify()` and `registerDelete()` methods with `auto` parameter set to false. When the entity log is called automatically by the framework, this parameter is set to true.

== Setting Up Entity Log

You can set up entity log in the *Audit -> Entity Log* view.

Also, you can set up entity log by entering some records in the database if you want to include the configuration to the database initialization.

Logging is configured using the `LoggedEntity` and `LoggedAttribute` entities corresponding to `AUDIT_LOGGED_ENTITY` and `AUDIT_LOGGED_ATTR` tables.

`LoggedEntity` defines the types of entities that should be logged. `LoggedEntity` has the following attributes:

* `name` – the name of the entity meta-class, for example, `sample_Order`.
* `auto` – defines if the system should log the changes when `EntityLog` is called with `auto` = `true` parameter (called by entity listeners).
* `manual` – defines if the system should log the changes when `EntityLog` is called with auto = `false` parameter.

`LoggedAttribute` defines the entity attribute to be logged and contains a link to the `LoggedEntity` and the attribute name.

To set up logging for a certain entity, add the corresponding entries into the `AUDIT_LOGGED_ENTITY` and `AUDIT_LOGGED_ATTR` tables.

In the example, logging changes of the `phone` attribute of the `Customer` entity is set up while database initialization:

[source,xml,indent=0]

== Viewing Entity Log

To view the entity log content, go to the *Audit -> Entity Log* view. Set necessary filters to find log entries.

Also, you can access the log for a certain entity from any application screen.

Log entries are stored in the `AUDIT_ENTITY_LOG` table corresponding to the `EntityLogItem` entity. Changed attribute values are stored in the `CHANGES` column and are converted to instances of `EntityLogAttr` entity.

In the example below, an edit screen for the `Order` entity shows tables with the entity log content.

Here is a fragment of the screen XML descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/audit/ex1/screen/order/order-edit.xml[tags=order-xml]
----

<1> Loading a collection of `EntityLogItem` into the `entityLogItemsDc` data container.
<2> Loading associated `EntityLogAttr` instances into the `entityLogAttrDc` data container.
<3> A table connected to the `entityLogItemsDc` container.
<4> A table connected to the `entityLogAttrDc` container.

`Order` screen controller looks like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/audit/ex1/screen/order/OrderEdit.java[tags=order-java]
----

<1> The `onBeforeShow` method loads data before showing the screen.
<2> In the `ItemChangeEvent` handler of the `orderDc` container, a parameter is set to the dependent loader and it is triggered.
