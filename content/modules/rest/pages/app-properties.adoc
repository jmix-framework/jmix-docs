= REST Properties

Jmix REST properties allow you to configure different aspects of the behavior of the generic REST endpoints.

[[entities-api-properties]]
== Entities API


[[jmix.rest.default-max-fetch-size]]
=== jmix.rest.default-max-fetch-size

Defines the default maximum amount of entity instances that are returned by the API.
