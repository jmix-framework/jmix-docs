= Access Control

To access protected resources (REST API endpoints) the client must provide a valid access token.

The operations for obtaining a token for the Generic REST API are implemented by the Authorization Server add-on. Its starter (`io.jmix.authserver:jmix-authserver-starter`) is automatically included when you add the REST API add-on using Jmix Studio. The Authorization Server add-on is based on {spring-authorization-server-docs}/index.html[Spring Authorization Server^] framework.

The OAuth 2.1 protocol specifies several ways to obtain a token, called grant types. Below we explain how to use the Client Credentials and Authorization Code grants.

[[client-credentials-grant]]
== Client Credentials Grant

The {oauth-specification-page}#name-client-credentials-grant[Client Credentials grant^] enables getting access tokens from the authorization server by providing registered client credentials in the request. This grant type should be used in the machine-to-machine communication.

The idea is the following:

* The client with id and secret is registered in Jmix application.
* Jmix resource and row-level roles are assigned to the client.
* Client application uses client id and secret to obtain access token.
* Using this token the client application can access protected REST API endpoints with permissions included to the roles assigned to the client.

An example of registering a client in the `application.properties` file and getting an access token with the Client Credentials grant can be found in the xref:getting-started.adoc#obtaining-access-token[Getting Started] section.

Alternatively to specifying client properties in the `application.properties` file, clients may be registered by providing a `RegisteredClientRepository` bean. See {spring-authorization-server-docs}/core-model-components.html#registered-client-repository[Spring Authorization Server documentation^] for details.

NOTE: If you create a `RegisteredClientRepository` then `application.properties` won't be analyzed.

[[authorization-code-grant]]
== Authorization Code Grant

You can read about the Authorization Code grant in the {oauth-specification-page}#name-authorization-code-grant[OAuth 2.1 specification^].

This flow allows you to obtain an access token with permissions of a real Jmix application user. You deal with the Authorization Code grant when you authorize using Google or Facebook on any website. A special login form is displayed by Jmix application, Jmix app validates credentials and if they are valid the access token is issued by a series of HTTP requests between the client application and Jmix application.

In order to enable the grant type in Jmix application you need to define a client that supports this grant type.

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=myapp-client-registration]
----

Keep in mind that by default Spring Authorization server configures the following endpoint URLs:

* authorization endpoint: `/oauth2/authorize`, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize`
* token endpoint: `/oauth2/token`, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token`

In this example we will use the https://oauthdebugger.com[^] site for token issuing testing. It will emulate an external application that requires access to Jmix resources and that needs to obtain an access token. In your own application you will need to implement steps described in the OAuth 2.1 protocol specification: send a request to the authorization endpoint, handle the redirect, extract the authorization code from it, make a request for the token endpoint to exchange the authorization code for the access token, etc.

Open https://oauthdebugger.com[^]. Fill in the fields:

* *Authorize URI*: ++http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize++
* *Client ID*: myapp
* *Scope*: leave this field empty
* *Use PKCE?*: enable the checkbox

image::oauthdebugger-website.png[align="center"]

Remember the value of the Code Verifier field. We will need it later.

Click the *SEND REQUEST* button on the bottom of the page.

You should see a special login form provided by Jmix application where you should enter credentials of existing Jmix user.

image::authserver-login-form.png[align="center"]

The access token you will get later as a result of all steps will be associated with this user and all requests to Jmix REST API will consider this user permissions (resource roles and row-level roles).

If credentials are valid, you should be redirected to the Redirect URI https://oauthdebugger.com/debug[^] that was defined in `application.properties`. Authorization code must be added as a `code` URL parameter, e.g. `++https://oauthdebugger.com/debug?code=BdgQArzTaj_xna_a0-PoUIQwszMR0xPkToxcktd5wPe4SbO18qBYStqJePOPNaoe9cuIJe0nac0cw0yVC9Iv3SeofEYbMZhMKldoJQQwcBUnBTfp2AyQayDlaE8KPaCf&state=sujodv3j7eh++`

To exchange this authorization code for access token you need to execute another HTTP request to the token endpoint of Jmix application. We will use the `curl` command line tools for this. Use the `code_verifier` value from the initial page of the https://oauthdebugger.com[^].

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token \
   --basic --user myapp:myappsecret \
   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
   -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
   -d "redirect_uri=https://oauthdebugger.com/debug" \
   -d "code=c9ehHTJyT84mX-v2v2Q8sbAxkAFYg-gjfZDJImu5ExZVGLUyWn_J2-afs_m7kiv7MwjD-XXVRQtwz_6H-JTb4NvuWiUw6-5vrF75LtyNYAovuvSJQ680nQwv3PbhB4Y-" \
   -d "code_verifier=zdhRZIStXgwonFfvNYo2oI6nYuYt022LdcZF8eh3LGE" \
   -d "code_challenge_method=S256"
----

As a result, you should get something like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "access_token":"Q6zvq8qGMUrN1VgouerOp4TJrry2f8oqL6mix8lDW-VKD_JHZXx0xv-ZZ_Zg_qgaHNw_wmeX6Qs0SlvEiFCyHqJ-PjqsnNkfF1XNKCAV43GQO0QeqmuV2sMiLgzY-m5r",
  "refresh_token":"DSINNaxmYykPrs3bDaKqaRgnrQDeZYInEF0yjtj2Vzkf5Nbf7OA0N09uQFN97MUmqaHBIXVxJFPQHtIbn-BM6Di035P68NqiIVfCawR5m6qQ6HbD6pQsCqAo-FBYAMqv",
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":299
}
----

[[custom-login-form]]
=== Custom Login Form

This section contains an example of replacing the standard login form provided by the Authorization Server add-on with a custom one.

First, create a login form template. The Authorization Server add-on includes the https://www.thymeleaf.org[Thymeleaf^] template engine as a dependency, so you can use it for your own login form.

Create a new file named `my-as-login.html` and place it in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory. This is a default location where Thymeleaf will search for templates.

.my-as-login.html
[source,html]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/resources/templates/my-as-login.html[]
----

You may notice that the form uses styles and an image located at the `+/my-as-login/styles/**+` and `+/my-as-login/icons/**+` paths, respectively.

Download the compiled https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/[Bootstrap^] CSS files and copy the `bootstrap.min.css` file into the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/my-as-login/styles` directory.

NOTE: `META-INF/resources` is one of the default places where Spring searches for static resources.

Create the `as-login.css` file in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/my-as-login/styles` directory:

.as-login.css
[source,css]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/my-as-login/styles/as-login.css[]
----

Take any icon (e.g., Jmix logo), rename it to `as-login-icon.png` and place it in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/my-as-login/icons` directory.

Next, you need to instruct Spring Security to allow access to files with styles and images. Create a Spring configuration that permits access to URLs where login form resources are located.

.MySecurityConfiguration.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/config/MySecurityConfiguration.java[tags=whole-class]
----
<1> This bean must have a higher precedence than the security filter chain from the `FlowuiSecurityConfiguration`.

Finally, instruct the application that the new login form must be used instead of the one provided by the Authorization Server add-on using the following application property:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/resources/application-custom-login-form.properties[tags=login-page-view-name]
----

After completing all the above steps, your authorization server login page should look similar to this one:

image::custom-login-form.png[align="center"]

[[refresh-token-grant]]
== Refresh Token Grant

You can read about Refresh Token grant in {oauth-specification-page}#name-refresh-token-grant[OAuth 2.1 specification^]. The `refresh-token` grant type should be registered for the client:

[source,properties]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=myapp-client-registration-authorization-grant-type]
----

To exchange the refresh token for a new access token you need to execute HTTP request to the token endpoint of Jmix application. We will use the `curl` command line tools for this.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token \
   --basic --user myapp:myappsecret \
   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
   -d "grant_type=refresh_token" \
   -d "refresh_token=zN2i5JooLfi0iqNJzaE-iiEiC2oHStv_X-kOaLuqX6ZNyRCs0EaNLik1xZrz-TPHfNEahLS2c402S_1kAO09K2x6oi3LFgpFoyr9snwE3ZXJ3Lp5AVH7s4YUBOXi0VRc"
----

[[resource-owner-password-credentials-grant]]
== Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

The Resource Owner Password Credentials grant has been removed from the OAuth 2.1 specification as it is not secure. However, it may be useful in some cases, so Jmix framework provides support for it. You can read more about the Resource Owner Password Credentials grant in the {oauth-2_0-specification-page}#section-4.3[OAuth 2.0 specification^].

In short, this flow allows you to obtain an access token with permissions of a real Jmix application user. Jmix user credentials are passed in the request body.

To enable the grant type, the "password" grant type must be registered for the client in the `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/resources/application-password-grant.properties[tags=authorization-grant-types]
----

A full set of application properties may be as follows:

[source,properties]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/resources/application-password-grant.properties[tags=password-grant-all-props]
----

To obtain an access token, the client must make a request to the token endpoint. The request content type must be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. The `grant_type` parameter should have the `password` value. `username` and `password` parameters must contain Jmix user credentials. The `Authorization` header must define the basic authentication using client id and secret registered in `application.properties`. In the example above they are `myapp` and `mysecret`.

If using the `curl` utility, the request will look as follows:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token \
   --basic --user myapp:mysecret \
   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
   -d "grant_type=password" \
   -d "username=user1" \
   -d "password=pass1"
----

The following result will be returned:

[source,json]
----
{
  "access_token":"Q6zvq8qGMUrN1VgouerOp4TJrry2f8oqL6mix8lDW-VKD_JHZXx0xv-ZZ_Zg_qgaHNw_wmeX6Qs0SlvEiFCyHqJ-PjqsnNkfF1XNKCAV43GQO0QeqmuV2sMiLgzY-m5r",
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":3599
}
----

If you need a refresh token to be returned as well, then register the "refresh_token" grant for the client:

[source,properties]
----
spring.security.oauth2.authorizationserver.client.myclient.registration.authorization-grant-types=password,refresh_token
----

[[anonymous-access]]
== Anonymous Access

By default, all endpoints are only available after a successful authentication against the application.
But it is also possible to expose certain parts of the REST API without authentication. This is possible by using the anonymous access functionality of Jmix. In this case, the API request is performed as the user `anonymous`, which is configured by default in a Jmix application.

For every secured endpoint that is called without the `Authentication` header, the user will be authenticated with the `anonymous` user session.

To whitelist specific endpoints for anonymous access, set a comma-separated list of URL patterns in the xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.rest.anonymous-url-patterns[jmix.rest.anonymous-url-patterns] application property. For example:

[source,properties]
----
jmix.rest.anonymous-url-patterns = \
  /rest/services/productService/getProductInformation,\
  /rest/entities/Product,\
  /rest/entities/Product/*
----

The last pattern in the example above is needed if you want to update or delete the `Product` entity, because in this case the URL has the id part.

Once this setting is in place, it is possible to interact with the `ProductService` without sending an `Authorization` header:

.GetProductInformation Request
[source, http request]
----
GET {{baseRestUrl}}
         /services
         /productService
         /getProductInformation
         ?productId=123
# Authorization: not set
----

This request will respond in a successful response of the Service:

.HTTP/1.1 200
[source, json]
----
{
  "name": "Apple iPhone",
  "productId": "123",
  "price": 499.99
}
----

If you want to provide anonymous access to some xref:entities-api.adoc[entities] endpoints, make sure the `anonymous` user has rights to these entities. You can do it by creating a xref:security:resource-roles.adoc[resource role] and assigning it to the `anonymous` user in the `DatabaseUserRepository.initAnonymousUser()` method. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@ResourceRole(name = "AnonymousRestRole", code = AnonymousRestRole.CODE, scope = "API")
public interface AnonymousRestRole {

    String CODE = "anonymous-rest-role";

    @EntityAttributePolicy(entityClass = Product.class,
        attributes = "*",
        action = EntityAttributePolicyAction.MODIFY)
    @EntityPolicy(entityClass = Product.class,
        actions = {EntityPolicyAction.READ, EntityPolicyAction.UPDATE})
    void product();
}
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Primary
@Component("UserRepository")
public class DatabaseUserRepository extends AbstractDatabaseUserRepository<User> {
    // ...

    @Override
    protected void initAnonymousUser(User anonymousUser) {
        Collection<GrantedAuthority> authorities = getGrantedAuthoritiesBuilder()
                .addResourceRole(AnonymousRestRole.CODE)
                .build();
        anonymousUser.setAuthorities(authorities);
    }
}
----

TIP: The anonymous access feature *does not* require that `anonymous` user has the `rest-minimal` role.

[[predefined-roles]]
== Predefined Roles

*REST: minimal access* (`rest-minimal`): Allows users to interact with the application via the API.

[[specific-policies]]
== Specific Policies

*rest.enabled* xref:security:resource-roles.adoc#specific-policy[specific policy] grants access to REST API endpoints. You should either assign the user the `rest-minimal` role or add this specific policy to any of other user roles.
