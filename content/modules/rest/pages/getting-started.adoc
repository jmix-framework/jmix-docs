= Getting Started with REST
:page-aliases: rest:quick-start.adoc

This section contains a practical guide on getting started with the generic REST API.

Letâ€™s consider that we want to retrieve information about users in the application through the REST API.

First, add the Generic REST add-on to your project according to the xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] section and start the application.

[[obtaining-access-token]]
== Obtaining Access Token

In order to access the protected resource the client must present a valid access token. The OAuth 2.1 specification provides several ways to get an access token from the authorization server. They are called grant types. In this example we will use the {oauth-specification-page}#name-client-credentials-grant[Client Credentials grant^].

The idea is that in Jmix application we must register the client (e.g. an external application that needs to access Jmix REST API), define client id and secret, and then using these credentials we will be able to get the access token by a special HTTP request.

Functionality responsible for issuing tokens and supporting all OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect 1.0 protocol features are located inside the Authorization Server addon that must have been already included during the installation of the REST API add-on (`io.jmix.authserver:jmix-authserver-starter`). The Authorization Server add-on is built on top of https://spring.io/projects/spring-authorization-server[Spring Authorization Server^].

The simplest way to register a client is to add standard Spring Authorization Server application properties:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=my-client-registration]
----

The next set of application properties is Jmix-specific and defines which resource and row-level role must be "linked" to the access token issued to the client. In this example we will assign two resource roles:

* `rest-minimal` (REST: minimal access) - to enable REST API endpoints access
* `user-management` (User management) - to allow operations with the User entity using REST API

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=my-client-role-assignment]
----

The `user-management` role looks as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/security/UserManagementRole.java[tags=user-management-role]
----
<1> The API scope indicates the role will be applied for REST API requests

After these properties are defined in the application it should be possible to obtain access tokens. In this example, we will use the `curl` command-line tool for interacting with the REST API.

[source, bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token \
   --basic --user my-client:my-secret \
   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
   -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
----

TIP: On Windows, remove `\` symbols and write the command in a single line.

As a result you should get something like this:

.HTTP/1.1 200
[source, json]
----
{
  "access_token":"hKhgNyGMTqaKd6prH-GoHF8zFVTSr9tKKyE3OnMoafRO4FT4Xq_cewHr28cIRITaRmF0olRXpVTyFdxcOPTAl8Vc7xopHrdNuXNXwEeBn7NSiEMvQXW5zO0dwMn_H8FQ",
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":299
}
----

The `access_token` attribute is the token you can use for further requests as part of the `Authorization` Header. It acts as a temporary credential that grants you access to the application.

[[retrieve-entity-list]]
== Retrieve Entity List

With the access token you can use the generic REST API endpoints to load a list of users (replace `<access_token>` with the value obtained on the previous step). In this case, we will fetch all the users that are present in the application through the Entities API:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/rest/entities/User \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"
----

The response will contain all users that are available in the application:

.HTTP/1.1 200
[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "_entityName": "User",
    "_instanceName": "[admin]",
    "id": "60885987-1b61-4247-94c7-dff348347f93",
    "version": 1,
    "active": true,
    "username": "admin"
  }
]
----
