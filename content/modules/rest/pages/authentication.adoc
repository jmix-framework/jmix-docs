= Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization operations for the REST API add-on are performed by the Authorization Server add-on (its starter `io.jmix.authserver:jmix-authserver-starter` is automatically included when you add the REST API add-on using Jmix Studio). The Authorization Server add-on is based on {spring-authorization-server-docs}/index.html[Spring Authorization Server^] framework. You may address Spring documentation for details.

To access a protected resource (REST API endpoints) the client must provide a valid access token. The OAuth 2.1 protocol specifies several ways to obtain a token.

[[client-credentials-grant]]
== Client Credentials Grant

The {oauth-specification-page}#name-client-credentials-grant[Client Credentials grant^] enables getting access tokens from the authorization server by providing registered client credentials in the request.

An example of registering a client in the `application.properties` file and getting an access token with the Client Credentials grant may be found in the xref:getting-started.adoc#obtaining-access-token[Getting Started] section.

Alternatively to specifying client properties in the `application.properties` file, clients may be registered by providing a `RegisteredClientRepository` bean. See {spring-authorization-server-docs}/core-model-components.html#registered-client-repository[Spring Authorization Server documentation^] for details.

NOTE: If you register a `RegisteredClientRepository`, then the `application.properties` won't be analyzed.

[[authorization-code-grant]]
== Authorization Code Grant

You can read details about the Authorization Code grant in the {oauth-specification-page}#name-authorization-code-grant[OAuth 2.1 Framework documentation^].

In order to enable the grant type in Jmix application you need to define a client that supports this grant type.

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=myapp-client-registration]
----

In this example we will use the https://oauthdebugger.com site for token issuing testing. It will emulate an external application that requires access to Jmix resources and that needs to obtain an access token.

Open the https://oauthdebugger.com. Fill the fields:

* *Authorize URI*: http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize
* *Client ID*: myapp
* *Scope*: leave this field empty
* *Use PKCE?*: enable the checkbox

image::oauthdebugger-website.png[align="center"]

Remember the value of the Code Verifier field. We will need it later.

Click the *SEND REQUEST* button on the bottom of the page.

You should see a special login form provided by Jmix application where you should enter credentials of existing Jmix user. The access token you will get later as a result of all steps will be associated with this user and all requests to Jmix REST API will consider this user permissions (resource roles and row-level roles).

If credentials are valid, you should be redirected to the Redirect URI https://oauthdebugger.com/debug that was defined in `application.properties`. Authorization code must be added as a `code` URL parameter, e.g. `https://oauthdebugger.com/debug?code=BdgQArzTaj_xna_a0-PoUIQwszMR0xPkToxcktd5wPe4SbO18qBYStqJePOPNaoe9cuIJe0nac0cw0yVC9Iv3SeofEYbMZhMKldoJQQwcBUnBTfp2AyQayDlaE8KPaCf&state=sujodv3j7eh`

To exchange this authorization code for access token you need to execute another HTTP request to the token endpoint of Jmix application. We will use the `curl` command line tools for this. Use the `code_verifier` value from the initial page of the https://oauthdebugger.com.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token \
   --basic --user myapp:myappsecret \
   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
   -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
   -d "redirect_uri=https://oauthdebugger.com/debug" \
   -d "code=c9ehHTJyT84mX-v2v2Q8sbAxkAFYg-gjfZDJImu5ExZVGLUyWn_J2-afs_m7kiv7MwjD-XXVRQtwz_6H-JTb4NvuWiUw6-5vrF75LtyNYAovuvSJQ680nQwv3PbhB4Y-" \
   -d "code_verifier=zdhRZIStXgwonFfvNYo2oI6nYuYt022LdcZF8eh3LGE" \
   -d "code_challenge_method=S256"
----

As a result, you should get something like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "access_token":"Q6zvq8qGMUrN1VgouerOp4TJrry2f8oqL6mix8lDW-VKD_JHZXx0xv-ZZ_Zg_qgaHNw_wmeX6Qs0SlvEiFCyHqJ-PjqsnNkfF1XNKCAV43GQO0QeqmuV2sMiLgzY-m5r",
  "refresh_token":"DSINNaxmYykPrs3bDaKqaRgnrQDeZYInEF0yjtj2Vzkf5Nbf7OA0N09uQFN97MUmqaHBIXVxJFPQHtIbn-BM6Di035P68NqiIVfCawR5m6qQ6HbD6pQsCqAo-FBYAMqv",
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":299
}
----

[[refresh-code-grant]]
== Refresh Code Grant

You can read about Refresh Code grant in {oauth-specification-page}#name-refresh-token-grant[OAuth 2.1 specification^]. The `refresh-token` grant type should be registered for the client:

[source,properties]
----
include::example$/rest-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=myapp-client-registration-authorization-grant-type]
----

To exchange the refresh token for a new access token you need to execute HTTP request to the token endpoint of Jmix application. We will use the `curl` command line tools for this.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token \
   --basic --user myapp:myappsecret \
   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
   -d "grant_type=refresh_token" \
   -d "refresh_token=zN2i5JooLfi0iqNJzaE-iiEiC2oHStv_X-kOaLuqX6ZNyRCs0EaNLik1xZrz-TPHfNEahLS2c402S_1kAO09K2x6oi3LFgpFoyr9snwE3ZXJ3Lp5AVH7s4YUBOXi0VRc"

[[anonymous-access]]
== Anonymous Access

By default, all endpoints are only available after a successful authentication against the application.
But it is also possible to expose certain parts of the REST API without authentication. This is possible by using the anonymous access functionality of Jmix. In this case, the API request is performed as the user `anonymous`, which is configured by default in a Jmix application.

For every secured endpoint that is called without the `Authentication` header, the user will be authenticated with the `anonymous` user session.

To whitelist specific endpoints for anonymous access, set a comma-separated list of URL patterns in the xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.rest.anonymous-url-patterns[jmix.rest.anonymous-url-patterns] application property. For example:

[source,properties]
----
jmix.rest.anonymous-url-patterns = \
  /rest/services/productService/getProductInformation,\
  /rest/entities/Product,\
  /rest/entities/Product/*
----

The last pattern in the example above is needed if you want to update or delete the `Product` entity, because in this case the URL has the id part.

Once this setting is in place, it is possible to interact with the `ProductService` without sending an `Authorization` header:

.GetProductInformation Request
[source, http request]
----
GET {{baseRestUrl}}
         /services
         /productService
         /getProductInformation
         ?productId=123
# Authorization: not set
----

This request will respond in a successful response of the Service:

.HTTP/1.1 200
[source, json]
----
{
  "name": "Apple iPhone",
  "productId": "123",
  "price": 499.99
}
----

If you want to provide anonymous access to some xref:entities-api.adoc[entities] endpoints, make sure the `anonymous` user has rights to these entities. You can do it by creating a xref:security:resource-roles.adoc[resource role] and assigning it to the `anonymous` user in the `DatabaseUserRepository.initAnonymousUser()` method. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@ResourceRole(name = "AnonymousRestRole", code = AnonymousRestRole.CODE, scope = "API")
public interface AnonymousRestRole {

    String CODE = "anonymous-rest-role";

    @EntityAttributePolicy(entityClass = Product.class,
        attributes = "*",
        action = EntityAttributePolicyAction.MODIFY)
    @EntityPolicy(entityClass = Product.class,
        actions = {EntityPolicyAction.READ, EntityPolicyAction.UPDATE})
    void product();
}
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Primary
@Component("UserRepository")
public class DatabaseUserRepository extends AbstractDatabaseUserRepository<User> {
    // ...

    @Override
    protected void initAnonymousUser(User anonymousUser) {
        Collection<GrantedAuthority> authorities = getGrantedAuthoritiesBuilder()
                .addResourceRole(AnonymousRestRole.CODE)
                .build();
        anonymousUser.setAuthorities(authorities);
    }
}
----

TIP: The anonymous access feature *does not* require that `anonymous` user has the `rest-minimal` role.
