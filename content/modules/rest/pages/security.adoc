= Security

When using the REST API, your client application needs to act under the permissions and restrictions of a particular user. This way Jmix can link the API calls to a user and apply the regular xref:security:authorization.adoc[Security Authorization] capabilities of Jmix to the requests.

The REST API supports a variety of security mechanisms that are available via the xref:security:index.adoc[Security Subsystem] of Jmix. Additionally, it adds API-specific parts on top like OAuth2 for securing the interactions via the API.

[[predefined-roles]]
== Predefined Roles

*REST: minimal access* (`rest-minimal`): Allows users to interact with the application via the API.

[[cors]]
== CORS

For security reasons, browsers don't allow Javascript network calls to resources outside the current origin. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS solves this restriction, as it lets you specify which cross-domain requests are allowed.

By default, all CORS requests to the REST API are allowed. To restrict the origins list you can define the xref:configuration.adoc#jmix.rest.allowedOrigins[allowedOrigins] application property.

For further customizations of the CORS configuration, see https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html5/#cors[Spring Security Documentation] on CORS.
