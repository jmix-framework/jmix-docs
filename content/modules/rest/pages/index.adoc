= Generic REST

Jmix provides a generic REST API that allows you to work with data model entities and business services without writing REST controllers on the backend. It automatically exposes endpoints for the following functionality:

* CRUD operations on entities.
* Calling of registered service methods.
* Execution of predefined JPQL queries.
* Uploading and downloading files.
* Returning information about the data model.
* Returning information about the current user and their permissions.

NOTE: You can explore the generic REST endpoints using the Swagger UI page at {rest-api-open-api}{page-component-display-version}[{rest-api-open-api}{page-component-display-version}^]

REST API uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and supports anonymous access. All REST API endpoints respect data access constraints imposed by
xref:security:index.adoc[security].
