= Update Entities

The Entities API also allows you to update already existing entities through the endpoint: `/entities/:entityName/:entityId` with the HTTP method `PUT`.

[[update-entity]]
== Update an Entity

When the entity is updated successfully, the HTTP response status code `200 - OK` is returned. By default, a JSON metadata representation of the entity is returned mainly containing the `id` attribute for further reference.

Here is an example of how to update an entity:

[source, http request]
.Create Customer Request
----
PUT http://localhost:8080/rest
            /entities
            /sample_Customer
            /13f01f59-8e5f-4fd9-802b-66501d49ac99

{
  name: "Updated Name"
}
----

[source, json]
.Response: 200 - OK
----
{
  "_entityName": "sample_Customer",
  "_instanceName": "Updated Name",
  "id": "13f01f59-8e5f-4fd9-802b-66501d49ac99"
}
----

The Update Entity API behaves similarly to the xref:entities-api/create-entities.adoc[Create Entities API] regarding validation and entity references. The main difference is how `1:N` associations and compositions are handled. The endpoint also allows you to <<Partial Updates,partially update entities>> by only having those attributes in the request JSON.


[[association-attributes]]
== Association Attributes

In case you want to update a `1:1` or `N:1` association attribute, it is enough to send the new ID of the entity to reference. For `1:N` or `M:N` associations an updated list of entity references changes what the entity is associated to.

CAUTION: The Update Entity endpoint will _replace_ the existing association collection for a `1:N` or `M:N` association with what is part of the request. For every entity reference that is not part of the request, the reference will be removed. But, the entity that has been referenced _will not be deleted_ from the database.

In this example, you will see how to update an `M:N` association between `Product` and `ProductTag`. Assuming that the stored Product before the update looks like this:

[source, json]
.Existing Product
----
{
  "id": "e1d586b4-aefb-2ee7-3b91-b07357b178ea",
  "price": 99.95,
  "name": "Outback Power Remote Power System",
  "version": 1,
  "tags": [
    {
      "id": "333f3a20-c47b-4bc9-ba34-a72d2d815695",
      "name": "shiny"
    },
    {
      "id": "c4c028f0-fec1-7512-83cd-c17537d1f502",
      "name": "great"
    }
  ]
}
----

In this example you would like to change the tags of the Product in the following ways:

* `great` should be removed from the tags.
* `amazing` should be added to the tags.
* The tag `shiny` should be kept.

[source, http request]
.Update Tag Associations Request
----
PUT http://localhost:8080/rest
            /entities
            /sample_Product
            /e1d586b4-aefb-2ee7-3b91-b07357b178ea
            ?responseFetchPlan=product-with-tags

{
  "name": "123",
  "price": 99.95,
  "tags": [
    {
      "id": "333f3a20-c47b-4bc9-ba34-a72d2d815695" // <1>
    },
    {
      "id": "d6ab132e-a0bd-a624-c6ad-cc544e83c584" // <2>
    }
  ]
}
----
<1> The ID of the product tag `shiny` is part of the request to keep the association.
<2> The ID of the product tag `amazing` is newly added to the association.

NOTE: As the ID of the product tag `great (c4c028f0-fec1-7512-83cd-c17537d1f502)` is not part of the request anymore, it will be removed from the association.

[source,json]
.Response: 200 - OK
----
{
  "id": "e1d586b4-aefb-2ee7-3b91-b07357b178ea",
  "createdBy": "admin",
  "price": 99.95,
  "name": "Outback Power Remote Power System",
  "version": 2,
  "tags": [
    {
      "id": "333f3a20-c47b-4bc9-ba34-a72d2d815695",
      "name": "shiny" // <1>
    },
    {
      "id": "d6ab132e-a0bd-a624-c6ad-cc544e83c584",
      "name": "amazing" // <2>
    }
  ]
}
----
<1> The `shiny` reference is still there, as it was part of the request
<2> The `amazing` reference has been added, whereas the tag `great` is not part of the association anymore.

[NOTE]
.Remove `*:1` Entity References
====
To remove a reference for `N:1` or `1:1` associations, you need to send in `null` as a value. The absence of the attribute in the request will _not_ lead that the reference is removed, because of the <<Partial Updates>> feature. In this case, the attribute would just be ignored and not changed as part of the request.
====

[[composition-attributes]]
== Composition Attributes

In case you want to update a Composition attribute, it is possible to directly update the content of the child entity as part of the update request for the parent entity. This is true for `1:1` as well as `1:N` compositions.

CAUTION: the Update Entity endpoint will _replace_ the existing composition collection with what is part of the request. For every entity reference that is not part of the request, the reference will be removed. Moreover, the entity that has been referenced before _will be deleted_ from the application as well.

In this example, you will see how to update a `1:N` composition between `Order` and `OrderLine`. Assuming that the stored Order before the update looks like this:

[source, json]
.Existing Order
----
{
  "id": "288a5d75-f06f-d150-9b70-efee1272b96c",
  "date": "2021-03-01",
  "amount": 130.08,

        "id": "1860904a-5444-9c3e-9dc1-1d7a26d9ac19",
        "name": "Solar-One HUP Flooded Battery 48V"
      },
      "quantity": 2.0,
      "version": 1
    },
    {

      },
      "quantity": 1.0,
      "version": 1
    }
  ],
  "version": 1,
  "customer": {
    "id": "f88597ff-009d-1cf2-4a90-a4fb5b08d835",
    "name": "Randall Bishop"
  }
}
----
<1> The first order line references the `Solar-One HUP Flooded Battery 48V` product.
<2> The second order line references the `Cotek Battery Charger` product.

In this example you would like to change the order lines in the following ways:

* The `quantity` of the Order Line with the product `Solar-One HUP Flooded Battery 48V` should be increased to `3.0`.
* The order line with the product `Cotek Battery Charger` should be removed.
* A new order line with the product `Outback Power Remote Power System` should be added.

}
----
<1> The ID of the existing order line is added to update the existing order line
<2> The `quantity` value is set to `3.0` for the `Solar-One HUP Flooded Battery 48V` product
<3> A new order line is added for the product `Outback Power Remote Power System`

NOTE: When updating a child entity, like the order line in the example above, the ID of the existing order line needs to be added, so that Jmix recognizes it as an update. Otherwise, it would treat the child entity as a new entity.

The response to this update request contains the desired changes:

  }
}
----
<1> The `quantity` has been updated for `Solar-One HUP Flooded Battery 48V`.
<2> The `version` attribute was increased to indicate the update.
<3> The new order line for `Outback Power Remote Power System` has been added to the order.

With this response, the order lines of the Order have been successfully updated.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When a child entity should not be updated, but still be kept in the composition, the ID of the existing order line needs to be part of the request nevertheless. This way Jmix recognizes it as still being part of the composition and does not delete it. Not putting that ID into the request would lead to Jmix deleting the entity (as this is how `@Composition` is handled), which might be considered accidental behavior, but is behaving as designed.

In the example from above when the order line for `Cotek Battery Charger (55b925e5-9f3a-a725-9eb3-1240f9c1fe9)` should not be changed at all, in the update it still needs to be listed with its ID:

<1> Child entities that are not changed (like `Cotek Battery Charger`) but should still be part of the composition are referenced through its `id`.

[[security-constraints-for-associations]]
== Security Constraints for Association/Composition

As we learned above, the Update Entity endpoint will _replace_ the existing association/composition collection with what is part of the request. For every entity reference that is not part of the request, the reference will be removed. Moreover, the entity that has been referenced before _will be deleted_ from the application as well.

Having that in mind, let's see how this situation behaves when Jmix Row-level Security is active for an entity:

Assuming you load an `Order` instance together with the nested collection of `OrderLine` instances.

There are security constraints that filter out some `OrderLine` instances, so you don't load them and don't know they exist. Say `line5` is not loaded by the client but exists in the database. If you update the Order and remove `line2` from the order lines, there are two outcomes:

* If the constraints have not been changed since you loaded the entities, the framework restores the filtered `line5` instance in the collection and deletes only `line2`, which is the correct behavior.
* If the constraints have been changed in a way that `line5` is now available to you, the framework cannot restore the information about filtered collection elements correctly. As a result, both `line2` and `line5` will be deleted.

You can eliminate possible data loss by sending a special system attribute in the JSON representing your entities. This attribute is called `__securityToken` and automatically included in resulting JSON if the `jmix.core.entitySerializationTokenRequired` application property is set to `true`.

Once you receive this `__securityToken` as part of the load response of the Entity, you can pass the value on to the Update Entity request. Here is an example of entity JSON including security token:

[source, json]
.Request with Security Token
----
{
  "id": "fa430b56-ceb2-150f-6a85-12c691908bd1",
  "lines": [
    {
      "id": "82e6e6d2-be97-c81c-c58d-5e2760ae095a",
      "description": "Item 1"
    },
    {
      "id": "988a8cb5-d61a-e493-c401-f717dd9a2d66",
      "description": "Item 2"
    }
  ],
  "__securityToken": "0NXc6bQh+vZuXE4Fsk4mJX4QnhS3lOBfxzUniltchpxPfi1rZ5htEmekfV60sbEuWUykbDoY+rCxdhzORaYQNQ==" // <1>
}
----
<1> The Security Token is the value that has been previously received by the Load Entities API.

The `__securityToken` attribute contains encoded identifiers of filtered instances, so the framework can always restore the required information regardless of changes in constraints.

[[partial-updates]]
== Partial Updates

It is possible to only send in the attributes that should be changed. In this case, all other attributes of the entity will stay untouched.

In the example below, you can send in an updated order date of the `Order` entity. Although the Order entity contains more attributes like `customer`, `amount`, `lines`.

[source, http request]
.Partial Order Update Request
----
PUT http://localhost:8080
         /entities
         /sample_Order
         /5a8adc2f-f4ef-17a9-9f97-1e715b3ade3d

  "date": "2020-12-06", //<1>
  "amount": 130.08, //<2>
  "version": 2 //<3>
}
----
<1> The `date` attribute was updated to the new order date.
<2> Other attributes of the entity stay untouched.
<3> The `version` attribute of the Order entity was increased to indicate the update.


[[bulk-update]]
== Bulk Update

The Update-Entity API also allows you to update multiple entities within one request. For this, the JSON request body should contain an array of JSON objects representing each entity.

[source, http request]
.Bulk Update Request
----

            /entities
            /sample_Customer

  },
  {
    "name": "Sarah Doogle 2"
  }

  }
]
----

In case of a violation of an entity validation, the entities will not be created, and a corresponding Error message will be returned. See  xref:entities-api/create-entities.adoc#_entity_validation[Entity Validation] for further details.

////
NOTE: All entities of the Bulk API are processed as part of one database transaction. This means if there is a validation violation in at least one of the entities, none of the entities will be created at all.
