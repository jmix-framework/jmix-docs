= 2. Template Definition

We'll design the message for the booking creator to include a subject line and a body section.

[[create-subject-template]]
== Creating a Message Subject Template

Let’s create a template for the _subject_ of the message that will be sent to the creator of a booking. This template will dynamically include the booking title, making the subject line personalized and relevant.

Navigate to the **Message Templates** view in your application. Click the *Create* button to start creating a new template.

After clicking *Create*, the template designer will open. Here’s how to configure the template:

* *Name*: Enter a human-readable name for the template, such as `Booking Email Subject`. This name helps you easily identify the template in the list.
* *Code*: Set the template code to `booking-email-subject`. This code will be used later to reference the template programmatically.
* *Type*: Select *Plain text* as the template type, since the subject line does not require HTML formatting.
* *Content*: Define the content of the template. For the subject line, use the following format:
+
[source,text,indent=0]
----
Booking confirmation for ${booking.title}
----
+
Here, `${booking.title}` is a placeholder that will be replaced with the actual title of the booking when the message is generated.

Once the template is configured, save it.

[[create-body-template]]
== Creating a Message Body Template

Next, we'll proceed to create the template that will form the _body_ of our message. Click the *Create* button once more, and then provide the following values for the template's attributes:

* *Name*: Enter a human-readable name for the template, such as `Booking Email Body`.
* *Code*: Set the template code to `booking-email-body`. This code will be used later to reference the template programmatically.
* *Type*: Select *Plain text* as the template type. This indicates that the template will contain HTML markup.
* *Content*: Define the content of the template. To do this, simply drag and drop the required elements from the palette located on the right side of the designer directly onto the design canvas.
+
Create the template by arranging elements from the palette to match the following content:
+
[source,text,indent=0]
----
Hello ${booking.creator.firstName}!

Thank you for booking your date and time for ${booking.title}.
Your time starts at ${booking.startDate?datetime} and ends at ${booking.endDate?datetime}

The booking took place ${today?date}.
The penalty for false is ${penalty?string.currency}.

Have a nice day,
Developer team.
