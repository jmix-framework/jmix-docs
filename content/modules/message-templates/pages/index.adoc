[[message-template-engine]]
=== Message Template Engine

The message generation process leverages the widely-adopted https://freemarker.apache.org/[Apache FreeMarker Template Engine^]. The system supports the creation of both `HTML` and `Plain Text` templates for maximum flexibility in your messaging.

[[html-template-editor]]
=== HTML Template Editor

The powerful https://github.com/GrapesJS/grapesjs[GrapesJS^] web component has been integrated to provide a user-friendly, visual editor for crafting HTML templates. This editor enables you to construct templates using a library of pre-designed HTML blocks. You can easily design your templates by simply dragging and dropping these blocks from the palette onto the canvas, streamlining the template creation process.

== Additionally

The *Message Templates* add-on supports integration with other Jmix add-ons:

* xref:multitenancy:index.adoc[Multitenancy] add-on. When both the *Multitenancy* and *Message Templates* add-ons are installed, templates, blocks, and groups are automatically segregated by _tenant_. This ensures that each tenant has access to their own set of templates, maintaining data isolation and security.

* xref:email:index.adoc[Email Sending] add-on. By installing the *Email Sending* add-on, you gain the ability to send emails generated from message templates. This integration allows you to create dynamic, template-based emails and send them directly from your application.

* xref:notifications:index.adoc[Notifications] add-on. Installing the *Notifications* add-on enhances your applicationâ€™s functionality by enabling the use of pre-made message templates when creating notifications. This integration simplifies the process of generating consistent and personalized notifications for users. For detailed information about the integration with the *Notifications* add-on, please refer to the xref:message-templates:notification-integration.adoc[] section.
