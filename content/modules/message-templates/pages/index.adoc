= Message Templates

The Message Templates add-on is designed as a successor to the Email Templates add-on familiar to users of the classic CUBA UI framework. This add-on offers a streamlined user interface to define and manage message templates. You can create reusable templates that can be easily integrated anywhere within your Jmix application, making it perfect for crafting emails, in-app notifications, and other message-driven features.

[[overview]]
== Overview

This add-on allows you to create and customize message templates that combine static content with dynamic parameters. You can design templates using either the visual HTML designer, which provides a wide range of HTML elements, or by integrating existing reports. The visual HTML editor offers a comprehensive toolkit for template design, making it easy to craft engaging and professional messages.

[[message-template-engine]]
=== Message Template Engine

The message generation process leverages the widely-adopted https://freemarker.apache.org/[Apache FreeMarker Template Engine^]. This means you can utilize the same familiar placeholders, template settings, and configuration options that youâ€™ve previously used, whether in older versions or with the xref:reports:index.adoc[Reports add-on]. The system supports the creation of both `HTML` and `Plain Text` templates for maximum flexibility in your messaging.

[[html-template-editor]]
=== HTML Template Editor

The powerful https://github.com/GrapesJS/grapesjs[GrapesJS^] web component has been integrated to provide a user-friendly, visual editor for crafting HTML templates. This editor enables you to construct templates using a library of pre-designed HTML blocks. You can easily design your templates by simply dragging and dropping these blocks from the palette onto the canvas, streamlining the template creation process. You'll find this visual approach particularly helpful in quickly building professional and engaging messages.
