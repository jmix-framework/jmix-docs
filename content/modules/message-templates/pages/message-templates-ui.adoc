= Message Templates UI

Upon installation of the Message Templates add-on, a *Message Templates* section will be added to the main navigation menu.

Within this section, users can navigate between three distinct views:

* *Message templates*, where individual message templates are managed
* *Template groups*, which allows you to organize templates into categories
* *Template blocks*, which are reusable components for building templates

Access to these views is determined by the user's assigned role. There are two roles specifically relevant to Message Templates:

* *Message Templates: full access*, which provides complete administrative and user privileges.
* *Message Templates: minimal access*, which grants minimal permissions to view and generate message templates.
