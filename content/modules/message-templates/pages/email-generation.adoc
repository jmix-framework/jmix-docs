= 3. Email Generation from Templates

Let's walk through an example of generating an email from subject and message body templates created in the previous section.

Before we begin, confirm that the xref:email:index.adoc[Email Sending] add-on is installed. If it is not currently installed, please install it before continuing.

Next, configure the required email xref:email:configuration.adoc[sending parameters] to enable successful email delivery.

== Adding Notify by Email Button

Let's add a *Notify by Email* button to the booking list view. This button will allow users to send an email notification to the creator of the booking selected in the data grid.

Find `booking-list-view.xml` in the *Jmix* tool window and double-click it. The view designer appears. Select `action` within the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel or in the XML descriptor. Next click the *Add* button in the component inspector panel. From the drop-down list, choose *Action*:

Select the `list_itemTracking` action in the *Add Action* dialog. The `list_itemTracking` action will automatically become active only when a specific item is selected in the associated `dataGrid`.

Configure the following attributes for this action:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/messagetemplates-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/sample/view/booking/booking-list-view.xml[tags=notify-email]
----

Then, in the `buttonsPanel` hbox, add a button and associate it with the newly created action.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/messagetemplates-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/sample/view/booking/booking-list-view.xml[tags=buttons-panel;notify]
----

== Generating an Email from the Template

Generate an `ActionPerformedEvent` handler method for the `notifyEmailButton` action. Add the logic to it:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/messagetemplates-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/sample/view/booking/BookingListView.java[tags=booking-list-view]
----
<1> Provides configuration properties for the FreeMarker template engine.
<2> A bean for generating messages from templates.
<3> A bean for sending emails.
<4> A bean for displaying notifications to the user.
<5> Fetches the selected `booking` and its `creator` from the `bookingsDataGrid`.
<6> Checks if the `creator` has an email address. If not, a notification is displayed, and the method exits.
<7> Configures the FreeMarker template engine with the specified version, encoding, and date format.
<8> Generates the message subject and body using FreeMarker templates (`booking-email-subject` and `booking-email-body`).
<9> Passes dynamic parameters (`booking`, `today`, and `penalty`) to the templates.
<10> Constructs an `EmailInfo` object with the recipientâ€™s email, subject, body, and content type.
<11> Attempts to send the email using the `emailer` bean. If an error occurs, a failure notification is displayed.
<12> Displays a success notification if the email is sent successfully.
