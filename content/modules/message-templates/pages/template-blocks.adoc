== Template Block Designer

When you create a new block, the *Template block* detail view will appear. This intuitive tool allows you to:

* Drag and drop predefined HTML elements onto the canvas.
* Customize these elements by adjusting their properties, such as size, color, alignment, and more.
* Arrange and organize elements to create a reusable block tailored to your needs.

On the *Attributes* tab you can set the `attributes` of block. In GrapesJS, `attributes` are key-value pairs associated with a block. Essentially, they are a way to store and manage additional data related to a particular element or block within your design. They allow you to customize and configure the behavior and appearance of your components beyond the basic properties like content, style, or position.
