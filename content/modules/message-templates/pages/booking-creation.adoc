= 1. Booking Creation and Management

In this chapter, you will learn how to create and configure the following components for your application:

* The `Room` enumeration. Define an enumeration to represent the available rooms in your system.
* The `Booking` entity. Create a `Booking` entity to manage reservations.
* CRUD views for bookings. Develop CRUD views to enable users to interact with the `Booking` entity.

To start, you’ll need to generate a `Room` enumeration consisting of the following values:

* `Senior`
* `Junior`
* `Middle`

The detailed instructions for creating enumerations can be found in the xref:tutorial:enumerations.adoc[Using Enumerations] section of the Tutorial.

Next, create the `Booking` entity. You can find detailed instructions for creating entities in the xref:tutorial:simple-crud.adoc[Simple CRUD] section of the Tutorial.

The `Booking` entity has the following attributes:

* `title` with `String` type. A descriptive name for the booking. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `room` - the room selected for the booking (using the `Room` enumeration). Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `startDate` and `endDate` with `DateTime` type: the date and time range for the booking. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `creator` - the user who created the booking (linked to the `User` entity many-to-one cardinality). Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.

Create detail view for the `Booking` entity. You’ll find the detailed steps for generating entity list and detail views in the xref:tutorial:simple-crud.adoc[Creating CRUD Views] section of the Tutorial. On the *Entity list view fetch plan* step, add the `creator` attribute to the selection.

Follow the suggested values at each step of the view creation wizard.
