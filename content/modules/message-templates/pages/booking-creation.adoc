= 1. Room Booking Application Creation

In this chapter, you will learn how to create and configure the following components for your application:

* The `Room` enumeration. Define an enumeration to represent the available rooms in your system.
* The `Booking` entity. Create a `Booking` entity to manage reservations.
* CRUD views for bookings. Develop CRUD views to enable users to interact with the `Booking` entity.

[[create-room-enum]]
== Creating Room Enumeration

To start, you’ll need to generate a `Room` enumeration consisting of the following values:

* `Senior`
* `Junior`
* `Middle`

The detailed instructions for creating enumerations can be found in the xref:tutorial:enumerations.adoc[Using Enumerations] section of the Tutorial.

[[create-booking-entity]]
== Creating Booking Entity

Next, create the `Booking` entity. You can find detailed instructions for creating entities in the xref:tutorial:simple-crud.adoc[Simple CRUD] section of the Tutorial.

The `Booking` entity has the following attributes:

* `title` with `String` type. A descriptive name for the booking. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `room` - the room selected for the booking (using the `Room` enumeration). Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `startDate` and `endDate` with `DateTime` type: the date and time range for the booking. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `creator` - the user who created the booking (linked to the `User` entity many-to-one cardinality). Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.

[[create-crud]]
== Creating CRUD Views

Create entity list and detail views for the `Booking` entity. You’ll find the detailed steps for generating entity list and detail views in the xref:tutorial:simple-crud.adoc[Creating CRUD Views] section of the Tutorial. On the *Entity list view fetch plan* step, add the `creator` attribute to the selection.

Follow the suggested values at each step of the view creation wizard.

[[run-app]]
== Running the Application

After creating the entity and CRUD views for it, you can run the application to see the new feature in action.

You’ll find the detailed steps for running application in the xref:tutorial:project-setup.adoc#run-app[Running Application from IDE] section of the Tutorial.

Click the *Debug* button (image:start-debugger.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Studio will show the warning about the data store and unapplied changelog files:

Click *Execute and proceed*.

Then Studio checks the difference between the project data model and the database schema. As long as you have created a new entity, Studio generates a Liquibase changelog for the corresponding changes in the database (creating the `BOOKING` table):

Click *Save and run*.

When the application is ready, open `++http://localhost:8080++` in your web browser and log in to the application with `admin` / `admin` credentials.

Choose the *Bookings* item from the *Application* menu. You will see the `Booking.list` view.

== Summary

In this section, you learned how to implement a Room Booking feature within your application. You gained practical experience in creating and configuring a `Room` enumeration, defining a `Booking` entity with key attributes, and generating CRUD views to enable users to manage room reservations effectively. You also learned how to run the application, apply database changes, and access the new booking feature through the application menu.
