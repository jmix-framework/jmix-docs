= Using Message Templates with Notifications

The Message Templates add-on seamlessly integrates with the xref:notifications:index.adoc[Notifications] add-on, which is included in the enterprise subscription plan. This integration enhances the functionality of your application by allowing you to use pre-made message templates when creating notifications.

How It Works

If both add-ons are included in your project, the `CreateNotificationDialog` interface will be updated to provide an option for selecting and using pre-configured message templates. This feature simplifies the process of creating notifications by enabling you to leverage existing templates instead of manually composing messages.
