= Using with Notifications

The Message Templates add-on seamlessly integrates with the xref:notifications:index.adoc[Notifications] add-on, which is included in the enterprise subscription plan. This integration enhances the functionality of your application by allowing you to use pre-made message templates when creating notifications.

If both add-ons are included in your project, the `CreateNotificationDialog` interface will be updated to provide an option for selecting and using pre-configured message templates.

After selecting a template, a dialog will appear, prompting you to enter the necessary parameters for that specific template. This dialog is dynamically generated based on the xref:message-templates.adoc#parameters[parameters] defined in the template itself, ensuring that you only provide the information that's relevant to the selected message.

Within this dialog, you can modify the parameter values as needed. You might, for example, need to enter a specific date, a confirmation code, or a personalized greeting. The available parameters and their expected data types (text, number, date, etc.) are determined by the template's design.

Once you've reviewed and confirmed the parameters, you can proceed to send the notification. The Message Templates add-on will then use the selected template and the entered parameter values to generate a complete, ready-to-send message. This process involves substituting the placeholder variables within the template with the corresponding values you've provided.

Finally, the Notifications add-on will handle the delivery of this message to the desired user.
