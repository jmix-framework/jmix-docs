= Template Groups

Message template groups can be useful for organizing message templates, particularly in projects with a large number of templates or when you need to manage access permissions for specific sets of templates.

Within the *Template Groups* application view, users have the ability to create new groups, edit existing ones, and remove groups that are no longer needed.

Once a group is created, you can assign it to a template. This allows you to categorize templates effectively and manage them based on their group association.
