= Tabbed Application Mode

This add-on allows you to open views in separate tabs inside main view, so multiple views can be opened simultaneously and the user can switch between them. Additionally, multiple views can be opened in the same tab, creating a view stack that is displayed as breadcrumbs.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
implementation 'io.jmix.tabbedmode:jmix-tabbedmode-flowui-starter'
----

. Change base class of the `MainView.java` from `StandardMainView` to `StandardTabbedModeMainView`.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/tabbedmode-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/main/MainView.java[tags=baseClass]
----

. In the `main-view.xml`, change the `xmlns` attribute value of the `mainView` element to use the `XSD` schema from the add-on:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/tabbedmode-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/main/main-view.xml[tags=wainView]
