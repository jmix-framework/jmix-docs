= What's New

This section covers new features of Jmix framework and Studio {page-component-display-version}, as well as some breaking changes to be aware of when upgrading from a previous version of the framework.

[[upgrade]]
== How To Upgrade

[IMPORTANT]
====
To create new projects with Jmix {page-component-display-version} or to upgrade an existing project, you need Studio {page-component-display-version} or later, so xref:studio:update.adoc[update] your Jmix Studio plugin first.

The minimal supported IntelliJ IDEA version is now {minimal-idea-version}.
====

See xref:studio:project.adoc#upgrading-project[Upgrading Project] section for how to upgrade your project using Studio. The automatic migration procedure makes the following changes in your project:

* Updates the version of Jmix BOM which in turn defines versions of all dependencies.
* Updates the version of Jmix Gradle plugin.
* Updates the version of Gradle wrapper to 8.10.2 in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`.
* If the project includes the REST API add-on, adds the `jmix.resource-server.authenticated-url-patterns` property, see details <<protecting-generic-rest-endpoints,below>>.
* Replaces calls to `dateTimeParameter()`, `dateParameter()` and `timeParameter()` methods of input dialog builder with calls to `localDateTimeParameter()`, `localDateParameter()` and `localTimeParameter()`. See details <<input-dialog-date-parameters,below>>.
* Adds the Grid Export Actions add-on to the project if it includes the Data Tools add-on. See details <<grid-export-actions-add-on-dependency,below>>.
* Sets the xref:flow-ui:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.default-trim-enabled[jmix.ui.component.default-trim-enabled] application property to `false`. See details <<trimming-in-text-fields,below>>.

See also the full list of <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>> that can affect your project after the upgrade.

[[updated-dependencies]]
== Updated Dependencies

The following major dependencies have been updated:

* Spring Boot https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.3-Release-Notes[3.3^].

* Vaadin https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases/tag/24.4.0[24.4^].

[[new-features]]
== New Features and Improvements

[[new-add-ons]]
=== New Add-ons

The following new add-ons are now available:

* The *Calendar* add-on provides a UI component that allows you to show data-bound events in a calendar with various views (day, week, month, etc.) and edit them by dragging and resizing.

* The *PivotTable* add-on provides a UI component that enables turning a data set into a summary table and manipulating it using 2D drag-and-drop UI.

* The xref:kanban:index.adoc[] add-on provides a UI component that represents a Kanban board. It shows workflow at different stages of a project, using cards for tasks and columns for stages.

* The xref:uiconstraints:index.adoc[] add-on allows you to control the visibility and accessibility of UI components using declarative policies defined in resource roles.

* The xref:rest-ds:index.adoc[] add-on allows you to access external entities from a remote Jmix application through the standard `DataManager` interface in the same way as local JPA entities.

[[data-binding-for-html-components]]
=== Data Binding for HTML Components

The xref:flow-ui:vc/html.adoc[HTML components] like `div`, `span`, `h1`...`h5` and others can now be bound to your data model entities declaratively in XML using the `dataContainer` and `property` attributes.

In many cases this will save you from writing code to set values in these components programmatically in view controllers.

[[fragment-renderer]]
=== Fragment Renderer

Renderers for xref:flow-ui:vc/components/virtualList.adoc[], xref:flow-ui:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc[] and other components can now be defined by xref:flow-ui:fragments/fragments.adoc[fragments].

The new `fragmentRenderer` XML element should specify the fragment Java class, for example:

[source,xml]
----
<virtualList itemsContainer="usersDc">
    <fragmentRenderer class="com.company.onboarding.view.userfragment.UserFragment"/>
</virtualList>
----

An example of the fragment used as a renderer:

[source,xml]
----
<fragment xmlns="http://jmix.io/schema/flowui/fragment">
    <data>
        <instance id="userDc" class="com.company.onboarding.entity.User">
            <loader id="userDl"/>
        </instance>
    </data>
    <content>
            <formLayout id="form" dataContainer="userDc">
                <textField id="usernameField" property="username" readOnly="true"/>
                <textField id="firstNameField" property="firstName"/>
                <textField id="lastNameField" property="lastName"/>
                <textField id="emailField" property="email"/>
            </formLayout>
        </hbox>
    </content>
</fragment>
----

The fragment renderer class should extend the `FragmentRenderer` base class with type parameters indicating the root component and rendered entity, for example:

[source,java]
----
@FragmentDescriptor("user-fragment.xml")
@RendererItemContainer("userDc")
public class UserFragment extends FragmentRenderer<FormLayout, User> {
}
----

The `@RendererItemContainer` annotation is used to specify the data container that accepts the rendered entity.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/pull/3699[#3699^] for more information.

[[asynchronous-tasks]]
=== Asynchronous Tasks

The new xref:flow-ui:async-tasks.adoc[UiAsyncTasks] bean allows you to execute an operation in a separate thread using the security context of the current user, and then update the UI with the result of that operation.

In comparison to xref:flow-ui:background-tasks.adoc[], this is a lightweight mechanism based on `CompletableFuture`.

[[trimming-in-text-fields]]
=== Trimming in Text Fields

The `textField` and `textArea` components now have the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/textField.adoc#trimEnabled[trimEnabled] attribute which controls whether the component trims spaces at the beginning and at the end of the entered string.

The xref:flow-ui:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.default-trim-enabled[jmix.ui.component.default-trim-enabled] application property specifies the default value of this attribute for the whole application. In new projects, this property is `true`. The Studio migration procedure sets this property to `false` for existing projects to minimize changes in behavior.

[[switching-theme-variants]]
=== Switching Theme Variants

The new `ThemeUtils` class contains methods for switching theme variants at runtime. This allows you to easily switch between light and dark themes in your application.

See an example in the xref:flow-ui:themes/themes.adoc#changing-theme-variants-at-runtime[Changing Theme Variants at Runtime] section.

[[immediate-validation-of-required-fields]]
=== Immediate Validation of Required Fields

The new xref:flow-ui:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.immediate-required-validation-enabled[jmix.ui.component.immediate-required-validation-enabled] application property allows you to disable validation of required fields on view opening.

[[grid-export-options]]
=== Grid Export Options

When using the xref:grid-export:index.adoc[] add-on, the set of export options can now be defined by a particular export action using its `setAvailableExportModes()` method and corresponding `availableExportModes` property in XML. The default set of options is defined by the xref:grid-export:properties.adoc#jmix.gridexport.default-export-modes[jmix.gridexport.default-export-modes] application property.

[[using-browser-time-zone]]
=== Using Browser Time Zone

If a time zone is not assigned to the user explicitly, it can be obtained from the web browser at login. This option is controlled by the `isAutoTimeZone()` method of the `HasTimeZone` interface implemented by the standard `User` entity scaffolded in projects.

In existing projects the behavior won't change, because this method returns `false` by default. In new projects `User` will be scaffolded with `isAutoTimeZone()` returning `true`.

[[advanced-endpoints-security-configuration]]
=== Advanced Endpoints Security Configuration

More options have been introduced for configuring endpoints security when using Authorization Server or OpenID Connect add-ons:

* `jmix.resource-server.authenticated-url-patterns` and `jmix.resource-server.anonymous-url-patterns` properties
* `AuthenticatedUrlPatternsProvider` and `AnonymousUrlPatternsProvider`
* `AuthenticatedRequestMatcherProvider` and `AnonymousRequestMatcherProvider`

See xref:security:custom-endpoints.adoc#token-based-authentication[Token Based Authentication] for more information.

The old `AuthorizedUrlsProvider` is deprecated, but still works, as well as `jmix.rest.authenticated-url-patterns` and `jmix.rest.anonymous-url-patterns` properties. It is recommended to move the configuration to the new interfaces or properties.

[[search-improvements]]
=== Search Improvements

The new `@ExtendedSearch` annotation can be added to an index definition interface to provide functionality of "Starts with" search. It instructs the Search add-on to create additional "virtual" subfields for each "real" field to store prepared prefix terms.

The xref:search:search-in-ui.adoc#search-field[searchField] component now allows users to open a *Search settings* window to set the search strategy, results size and, optionally, a set of entities to search only within these entities. If there are index definitions with `@ExtendedSearch` in the project, the list of strategies contains "Starts with".

`allTermsAnyField` and `allTermsSingleField` strategies have been deprecated.

[[rest-api-improvements]]
=== REST API Improvements

Generic xref:rest:index.adoc[REST API] now supports CRUD operations with DTO entities in the `/entities` endpoints. The search conditions provided to the `entities/:entityName/search` endpoint are converted to the `Condition` tree and passed to the `DataManager`. This allows you to request DTO entities that are in turn loaded from another REST API through the xref:rest-ds:index.adoc[].

The JSON search conditions can now include objects in property values, for example:

[source,json]
----
{
  "conditions": [
    {
      "property": "field1",
      "operator": "=",
      "value": {
        "_entityName": "Customer",
        "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

[[studio-component-inspector]]
=== Studio Component Inspector

The Jmix UI component inspector now groups the properties by categories: *General*, *Data Binding*, *Size*, *Position*, *Look & Feel*, *Other*. This new feature allows you to quickly locate the property you need without having to go through a long list.

Categories are displayed only in projects based on Jmix 2.4 and above.

Besides, the component inspector now provides better support for the `icon` property. You can click the "pencil" button in the value field to show a dialog with the list of available icons and select an icon from it.

[[composite-project-template-for-monorepo]]
=== Composite Project Template for Monorepo

We've added a new template for a composite project that is intended to be hosted in a monorepo. It provides a simple structure where all subprojects are located inside the root aggregate project:

[source]
----
composite-project/
    subproject1/
        src/
        build.gradle
        settings.gradle
    subproject2/
        src/
        build.gradle
        settings.gradle
    build.gradle
    settings.gradle
    README.md
----

This project layout is recommended if you are not going to store subprojects in separate repositories.

[[breaking-changes]]
== Breaking Changes

[[build-problem-with-enablejmixdatarepositories]]
=== Build Problem With EnableJmixDataRepositories

When `@EnableJmixDataRepositories` is used on the main application class extending `AppShellConfigurator`, a clean build fails with the following message:

[source]
----
> Task :vaadinPrepareFrontend FAILED
Could not read com.vaadin.flow.theme.Theme annotation from class com.company.onboarding.OnboardingApplication.
java.lang.TypeNotPresentException: Type [unknown] not present
----

The problem is caused by https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/19616[vaadin/flow#19616^] and will be fixed in a future patch.

To work around the problem, move the `@EnableJmixDataRepositories` annotation to a separate `@Configuration` class in the same package, for example:

[source,java]
----
package com.company.onboarding;

import io.jmix.core.repository.EnableJmixDataRepositories;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@EnableJmixDataRepositories
@Configuration
public class OnboardingConfiguration {
}
----

[[protecting-generic-rest-endpoints]]
=== Protecting Generic REST Endpoints

Due to improvements in endpoints security configuration (see <<advanced-endpoints-security-configuration,above>>), the following application property must be set to secure the Generic REST API endpoints:

[source,properties]
----
jmix.resource-server.authenticated-url-patterns = /rest/**
----

The Studio migration procedure adds it to `application.properties` automatically.

[[generic-rest-unauthorized-error]]
=== Generic REST Unauthorized Error

Previously, generic REST API returned HTTP 500 code if the request to a secured endpoint was performed without `Authorization` header. Now it correctly returns HTTP 401.

[[listmenu-styles]]
=== ListMenu Styles

xref:flow-ui:vc/components/listMenu.adoc[] component styles have been changed to fix the issue with focus ring:

- Changed margin and padding for the `ListMenu` itself.
- Increased `margin-inline-start` for list of sub menu.
- Changed paddings for `MenuBarItem`.

If you have defined your own styles for this component, you may need to adjust them.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3589[#3589^] for more information.

[[input-dialog-date-parameters]]
=== Input Dialog Date Parameters

The `dateTimeParameter()`, `dateParameter()` and `timeParameter()` methods of the xref:flow-ui:dialogs.adoc#input-dialog[input dialog] builder have been fixed: now they create parameters of `java.util.Date`, `java.sql.Date` and `java.sql.Time` type respectively. Previously they wrongly created `LocalDateTime`, `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` parameters.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3499[#3499^] for more information.

The Studio migration procedure automatically replaces calls to these methods with calls to `localDateTimeParameter()`, `localDateParameter()` and `localTimeParameter()` to keep compatibility with returning values.

[[grid-export-actions-add-on-dependency]]
=== Grid Export Actions Add-on Dependency

Previously, the xref:data-tools:index.adoc[] add-on contained transitive dependency to the xref:grid-export:index.adoc[] add-on. This dependency has been removed, so now export actions can be used only when the Grid Export Actions add-on is included explicitly.

The Studio migration procedure automatically adds the Grid Export Actions add-on to the project if it includes the Data Tools add-on.
