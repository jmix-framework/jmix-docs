= What's New

This section covers new features of Jmix framework and Studio {page-component-display-version}, as well as some breaking changes to be aware of when upgrading from a previous version of the framework.

[[upgrade]]
== How To Upgrade

[IMPORTANT]
====
To create new projects with Jmix {page-component-display-version} or to upgrade an existing project, you need Studio {page-component-display-version} or later, so xref:studio:update.adoc[update] your Jmix Studio plugin first.

The minimal supported IntelliJ IDEA version is now {minimal-idea-version}.
====

See xref:studio:project.adoc#upgrading-project[Upgrading Project] section for how to upgrade your project using Studio. The automatic migration procedure makes the following changes in your project:

* Updates the version of Jmix BOM which in turn defines versions of all dependencies.
* Updates the version of Jmix Gradle plugin.
* Updates the version of Gradle wrapper to 8.7 in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`.
* Add `lumoImports` property to `frontend/themes/<theme-name>/theme.json`.
* Replaces `@Autowired` with `@ViewComponent` for injection of `MessageBundle` in views.
* The `jmix.ui.component.filter-show-non-jpa-properties` application property is set to false.
* Usages of `io.jmix.flowui.component.validation.group.UiCrossFieldChecks` are replaced with `io.jmix.core.validation.group.UiCrossFieldChecks`.
* If the project uses an Oracle data store, `org.eclipse.persistence.oracle` dependency is added and JDBC driver dependency is updated.

[[new-features]]
== New Features and Improvements

[[superset-add-on]]
=== Superset Add-on

The new Superset add-on is designed to integrate Jmix applications with Apache Superset. It allows you to embed dashboards into application views.

See the Superset add-on xref:superset:index.adoc[documentation] for more information.

[[support-for-opensearch]]
=== Support for OpenSearch

The Search add-on now supports https://opensearch.org/[OpenSearch^] in addition to https://www.elastic.co[Elasticsearch^]. See the add-on's xref:search:index.adoc#installation[installation] section for how to choose the server.

[[fragments]]
=== Fragments

A fragment is a new UI building block that can be used as a part of views and other fragments.

Fragments allow for code reuse and help break down complex views into smaller, more manageable parts.

See the xref:flow-ui:fragments/fragments.adoc[] section for more information.

[[data-repositories-in-views]]
=== Data Repositories in Views

Now you can easily delegate loading and saving data in views to Spring Data repositories.

When creating an entity list or detail view, select the *Use Data Repositories* checkbox in the *Advanced* section of the wizard's first page, and choose an existing data repository from the dropdown. The wizard will generate the load and save delegates that invoke appropriate repository methods.

Load methods of repositories inherited from `JmixDataRepository` now support an additional argument of the `JmixDataRepositoryContext` type. It allows you to pass the filtering, paging and sorting parameters collected from UI components to the `LoadContext` object. As a result, all the features of `genericFilter`, `simplePagination` and `dataGrid` components will work seamlessly with data repositories.

[[lazy-tabs-in-tabsheet]]
=== Lazy Tabs in TabSheet

A tab in a xref:flow-ui:vc/layouts/tabSheet.adoc[] can now be marked as `lazy`. The content of such a tab will not be loaded automatically, which improves performance for views with many tabs containing a lot of UI components.

See the xref:flow-ui:vc/layouts/tabSheet.adoc#lazy-tabs[Lazy Tabs] section for more information.

[[twin-column-component]]
=== TwinColumn Component

The new xref:flow-ui:vc/components/twinColumn.adoc[] component lets users intuitively select items from a list or collection by moving them between two columns.

[[navigation-requires-origin-view]]
=== Navigation Requires Origin View

In order to fix https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3157[#3157^], the API of `ViewNavigators` has been changed: the navigation now requires you to specify an origin view. Old methods are deprecated, and it is recommended to replace them with the new ones accepting an origin view.

If the calling class is not a view, and you cannot pass `this` as an origin, use `UiComponentUtils.getCurrentView()`, for example:

[source,java]
----
viewNavigators.view(UiComponentUtils.getCurrentView(), viewId).navigate();
----

In UI tests, the current view can be obtained by `UiTestUtils.getCurrentView()`, for example:

[source,java]
----
View<?> parent = UiTestUtils.getCurrentView();
viewNavigators.view(parent, UserListView.class).navigate();
----

[[navigation-to-bpm-process-forms]]
=== Navigation to BPM Process Forms

When navigating to a process form, Jmix now uses the `taskId` or `processDefinitionId` URL query parameter. This allows for safe reloading of the webpage and saving a deep link to the form.

[[authentication-principal-resolver]]
=== AuthenticationPrincipalResolver

A mechanism of resolving a current user object has been introduced. It delegates to the chain of `AuthenticationPrincipalResolver` implementations that try to return a correct user object. The standard implementation in the Authorization Server add-on fixes the https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/2051[issue^] which prevented the use of xref:data-access:jpql-extensions.adoc#session-and-user-attributes[user attributes] in REST API requests.

An application project can provide its own `AuthenticationPrincipalResolver` implementations if needed.

[[resource-owner-password-credentials-grant]]
=== Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

The Authorization Server add-on now implements the Resource Owner Password Credentials grant. It can be used in trusted, legacy, or highly controlled environments for simple authentication of REST clients as registered Jmix application users.

See the Authorization Server add-on xref:authorization-server:obtaining-tokens.adoc#resource-owner-password-credentials-grant[documentation] for more information.

[[exposing-services-in-generic-rest]]
=== Exposing Services in Generic REST

The new experimental way of exposing service methods as Generic REST endpoints has been introduced.

Instead of creating the `rest-services.xml` file as described in the Generic REST xref:rest:business-logic.adoc#exposing-a-service[documentation], you can use the `io.jmix.rest.annotation.RestService` and `io.jmix.rest.annotation.RestMethod` annotations on the service class and business method respectively.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/1323[#1323^] for more information.

[[liquibase-changelog-aggregation]]
=== Liquibase Changelog Aggregation

The new *Aggregate Liquibase Changelogs* action is available in the data store context menu of Jmix Studio. It allows you to combine several latest changelogs into one, avoiding duplicated actions in changesets.

This feature can be used by developers before each commit to a shared code repository. It helps to maintain a tidy collection of changelogs and reduces the application startup time due to fewer changesets.

[[generation-of-ui-exception-handlers]]
=== Generation of UI Exception Handlers

Now you can generate a xref:flow-ui:exception-handlers.adoc[UI exception handler] using the *New -> Advanced -> UI Exception Handler* action of the Jmix tool window.

[[ui-component-structure-improvements]]
=== UI Component Structure Improvements

* You can easily convert one component into another using the *Convert to* action in the structure context menu.

* Multiple selected components can be wrapped into a TabSheet tab using the *Wrap into* action.

[[breaking-changes]]
== Breaking Changes

[[explicit-lumo-imports]]
=== Explicit Lumo Imports

The application theme must explicitly declare imports from Lumo theme, for example:

[source,json]
.frontend/themes/onboarding/theme.json
----
{
 "parent": "jmix-lumo",
 "lumoImports": [
  "typography",
  "color",
  "spacing",
  "badge",
  "utility"
 ]
}
----

The Studio migration process will automatically make this change.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3347[#3347^] for more information.

[[viewcomponent-for-injecting-messagebundle]]
=== @ViewComponent for Injecting MessageBundle

The `@ViewComponent` annotation must be used to inject `MessageBundle` into a view. The Studio migration process will automatically update all existing views.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/2812[#2812^] for more information.

[[lazy-loaded-soft-deleted-onetoone-reference]]
=== Lazy Loaded Soft Deleted OneToOne Reference

The lazy loading of soft-deleted one-to-one references has been fixed. Now it behaves the same as eager loading with fetch plans:

* Soft-deleted entities are loaded through one-to-one references from the owning side.

* Soft-deleted entities are NOT loaded through one-to-one references from the `mappedBy` side.

Previously, the behavior of lazy loading was opposite.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/2466[#2466^] for more information.

[[vectorlayer-default-style]]
=== VectorLayer Default Style

When using the Maps add-on, the default style is now removed with the `VectorLayer.removeAllStyles()` method. To restore the default style, add it explicitly before the others. For example:

[source,java]
----
@ViewComponent("map.vector")
private VectorLayer vector;

@Subscribe
private void onInit(final InitEvent event) {
    vector.removeAllStyles();
    vector.addStyles(
            Style.createDefaultStyle(),
            new Style());
}
----

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3140[#3140^] for more information.

[[flowui-security-configuration]]
=== FlowUI Security Configuration

The FlowUI security configuration has been reworked. The `io.jmix.securityflowui.FlowuiSecurityConfiguration` class is now deprecated. If your project extends this class, you must update your configuration to extend the new `io.jmix.securityflowui.security.FlowuiVaadinWebSecurity` class.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/pull/3182[#3182^] for more information.
