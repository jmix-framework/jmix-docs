== How To Upgrade

[IMPORTANT]
====
To create new projects with Jmix {page-component-display-version} or to upgrade an existing project, you need Studio {page-component-display-version} or later, so xref:studio:update.adoc[update] your Jmix Studio plugin first.

The minimal supported IntelliJ IDEA version is now {minimal-idea-version}.
====

See xref:studio:project.adoc#upgrading-project[Upgrading Project] section for how to upgrade your project using Studio. The automatic migration procedure makes the following changes in your project:

* Updates the version of Jmix BOM which in turn defines versions of all dependencies.
* Updates the version of Jmix Gradle plugin.
* Updates the version of Gradle wrapper to 8.2 in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`.

See also the full list of <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>> that can affect your project after the upgrade.
