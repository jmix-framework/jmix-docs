= What's New

This section covers new features of Jmix framework {page-component-display-version}, as well as some breaking changes to be aware of when upgrading from a previous version of the framework.

Version {page-component-display-version} doesn't come with a corresponding version of Studio. Instead, we recommend using the latest available https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/studio/install.html[Studio 2.x^].

== How To Upgrade

[IMPORTANT]
====
To create new projects with Jmix {page-component-display-version} or to upgrade an existing project, you need Studio 2.3 or later, so xref:studio:update.adoc[update] your Jmix Studio plugin first.

Studio 2.3 requires IntelliJ IDEA version 2023.3 or newer.
====

See xref:studio:project.adoc#upgrading-project[Upgrading Project] section for how to upgrade your project using Studio. The automatic migration procedure makes the following changes in your project:

* Updates the version of Jmix BOM which in turn defines versions of all dependencies.
* Updates the version of Jmix Gradle plugin.
* Updates the version of Gradle wrapper to 8.0.2 in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`.

See also the full list of <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>> that can affect your project after the upgrade.

[[new-features]]
== New Features and Improvements

[[sorting-by-multiple-columns-in-datagrid]]
=== Sorting by Multiple Columns in DataGrid

Sorting by multiple columns in xref:ui:vcl/components/data-grid.adoc[] is now possible when you click a column header while holding down the `Shift` key.

[[grouptable-sorts-by-grouping-columns]]
=== GroupTable Sorts by Grouping Columns

xref:ui:vcl/components/group-table.adoc[] now automatically adds sorting by grouping columns. So, when using pagination, the distribution of data between pages corresponds to grouping.

You can add the `sortOnGroupEnabled="false"` attribute to the `groupTable` element to turn off this feature.

[[collection-properties-in-generic-filter]]
=== Collection Properties in Generic Filter

The xref:ui:vcl/components/filter.adoc[] component now allows you to create conditions for collection (to-many) properties.

For example, in the xref:tutorial:index.adoc#data-model[Onboarding application], you can filter Users by the `steps` property and its nested properties: `steps.dueDate`, `steps.step.name`, etc. The JPA data store will automatically create an appropriate JPQL query with the `join` clause. Previously, you could achieve this only by defining a xref:ui:vcl/components/filter.adoc#jpql-conditions[JPQL condition] manually.

[[total-progress-in-filemultiuploadfield]]
=== Total Progress in FileMultiUploadField

xref:ui:vcl/components/file-multi-upload-field.adoc[] now displays the total progress of uploaded files. It provides better feedback to users when uploading many small files.

Use `totalProgressFormat` property to set a custom total label format and `totalProgressEnabled` property to set whether to display the total progress bar.

[[monitoring-loaders-in-screens]]
=== Monitoring Loaders in Screens

Data loaders now provide detailed monitoring data through the Micrometer API.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3023[#3023^] and https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/1704#issuecomment-1943207017[#1704^] for more information.

[[breaking-changes]]
== Breaking Changes

[[removed-flow-ui]]
=== Removed Flow UI

Last year, when we released Jmix 2.0, we announced that Classic UI would continue to exist in the Jmix 1.x branch, while Flow UI would be included in Jmix from version 2.0 onwards (see https://www.jmix.io/blog/extended-support-for-classic-ui/[Extended Support for Classic UI^]).

Therefore, we have removed Flow UI modules from Jmix 1.6.

If you have a project on Jmix 1.5 using Flow UI, migrate to the latest Jmix 2.x.

[[yarg-classes-moved-into-reports]]
=== YARG Classes Moved Into Reports

The YARG report engine has been moved from an external dependency into the Reports add-on sources. If you have used `++com.haulmont.yarg.*++` classes in your project, replace their imports to `++io.jmix.reports.yarg.*++`.

[[data-repositories-initialization]]
=== Data Repositories Initialization

Previously optional `@EnableJmixDataRepositories` annotation is now required to initialize data repositories in the project. See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3428[#3428^] and https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/1589[#1589^] for more information.

[[lazy-loaded-soft-deleted-onetoone-reference]]
=== Lazy Loaded Soft Deleted OneToOne Reference

The lazy loading of soft-deleted one-to-one references has been fixed. Now it behaves the same as eager loading with fetch plans:

* Soft-deleted entities are loaded through one-to-one references from the owning side.
* Soft-deleted entities are NOT loaded through one-to-one references from the mappedBy side.

Previously, the behavior of lazy loading was opposite.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/2466[#2466^] for more information.
