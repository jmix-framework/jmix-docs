= Style

The `Style` object enable developers to customize the color, size, font, and other visual properties of map xref:maps:features-geometries.adoc[features].

Styles can also be applied at the xref:maps:layers-sources.adoc[layer] level, defining a consistent appearance for all features within a layer.

== Style for PointFeature

To change the style for a xref:maps:features-geometries.adoc#point-feature[PointFeature], you typically define a `PointStyle` object with the desired appearance properties like `image`, `fill`, `stroke`, etc. and then apply that style to the `PointFeature`.

Using text instead of an image for the `PointFeature` allows you to display textual labels directly on the map at specified coordinates, providing clarity and context to the displayed data.

When utilizing text for `PointFeature`, you can customize the appearance of the text by adjusting properties like `font`, `fill`, `textAlign`, etc.

The example below demonstrates using textual label instead of an image for the `PointFeature`:

== Style for MarkerFeature

To change the marker icon, refer the following example:

Additionally, an example of customizing marker icons based on the geo-object's attributes is provided in the xref:maps:dispay-markers.adoc#use-markers[Use Custom Markers] section.

== Style for LineStringFeature

To change the style for a `LineStringFeature`, you typically define a `LineStringStyle` object with the desired appearance properties like `stroke`, `fill`, etc., and then apply that style to the `LineStringFeature`.

== Style for PolygonFeature

Changing the style for a `PolygonFeature` involves defining a new `PolygonStyle` with desired properties like `fill`, `stroke`, etc., and applying this style to the `PolygonFeature`.

[[select-mode-styles]]
== Select mode styles

Every feature type has default styles for xref:maps:layers-sources.adoc#select-mode[Select mode] in the vector source. These styles are applied when the user selects a feature on the map. To set custom select styles, each feature provides methods for adding styles.

For instance, here’s how to add custom select styles for a `PolygonFeature`:

include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/mapssample/view/style/SelectStyleView.java[tags=select-style]
----

NOTE: To apply select styles for all features in the source, set select styles to the vector layer.

[[modify-mode-styles]]
== Modify mode styles

The xref:maps:layers-sources.adoc#modify-mode[modify mode] is provided by vector sources. When this mode is activated, it generates points for the geometry’s vertices to enable modifications, such as adding new vertices and changing vertex positions. This mode also determines the styles for the generated vertices of the corresponding  geometry that are displayed on the map.

For instance, here’s how to set custom styles for the polygon vertex points:

NOTE: To apply modify styles to all features in the source, set the modify styles for the vector layer.
