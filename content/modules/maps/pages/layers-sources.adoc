= Layers and Sources

Layer – is a way to organize data on a map.

Layers can be raster or vector. Raster layers consist of raster images which is a grid of pixels, while vector layers consist of vector geometries.

[[tile-layer]]
== TileLayer

Layer with sources that provide pre-rendered, tiled images in grids that are organized by zoom levels for specific resolutions.

For more details see https://openlayers.org/en/v8.2.0/apidoc/module-ol_layer_Tile-TileLayer.html[TileLayer documentation^].

`TileLayer` supports three sources:

* <<osm-source,OsmSource>>
* <<xyz-source,XyzSource>>
* <<wms-source,WmsSource>>

[[osm-source]]
=== OsmSource

Source for the loading tiles from an https://www.openstreetmap.org[OpenStreetMap^] tile server and from xref:maps:map-services.adoc#xyz-tiles[XYZ tile] services. For more details see https://openlayers.org/en/v8.2.0/apidoc/module-ol_source_OSM-OSM.html[OSM documentation^].

The following example demonstrates how to display an OpenStreetMap tile layer.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/layers-view.xml[tags=osmSource]
----

[[xyz-source]]
=== XyzSource

Source for tile data with URLs in a set XYZ format that are defined in a URL template. By default, this follows the widely-used Google grid where x 0 and y 0 are in the top left. `XyzSource` can load tiles from xref:maps:map-services.adoc#xyz-tiles[XYZ tile] services. For more details see https://openlayers.org/en/v8.2.0/apidoc/module-ol_source_XYZ-XYZ.html[XYZ documentation^].

The following example demonstrates how to display a Thunderforest tile layer.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/layers-view.xml[tags=xyzSource]
----

[[wms-source]]
=== WmsSource

Source for tile data from xref:maps:map-services.adoc#web-map-service[WMS] (Web Map Service) servers. For more details see https://openlayers.org/en/v8.2.0/apidoc/module-ol_source_TileWMS-TileWMS.html[TileWMS documentation^].

The following example demonstrates how to display a tile layer with `WmsSource`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/layers-view.xml[tags=wmsSource]
----

[[image-layer]]
== ImageLayer

`ImageLayer` is used to work with static images or WMS images.

//Layer with server-rendered images that are available for arbitrary extents and resolutions.

[[image-static-source]]
=== ImageStaticSource

Source for displaying a single, static image. For more details see https://openlayers.org/en/v8.2.0/apidoc/module-ol_source_ImageStatic-Static.html[Static documentation^].

Example of showing image from URL. This example is taken from https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/static-image.html[OpenLayers -> Examples -> Static image^].

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/layers-view.xml[tags=imagestatic]
----

To display an image from the classpath, define the XML in the same way as shown in the example above:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/layers-view.xml[tags=imagestatic-classpath]
----

Additionally, you can achieve this in the Java controller using `StreamResource`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/LayersView.java[tags=programmaticSource;onInit;programmaticMap]
----

[[image-wms-source]]
=== ImageWmsSource

Source for xref:maps:map-services.adoc#web-map-service[WMS] servers providing single, untiled images. For more details see https://openlayers.org/en/v8.2.0/apidoc/module-ol_source_ImageWMS-ImageWMS.html[ImageWMS documentation^].

The example of using `ImageWmsSource` is taken from https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/wms-image.html[OpenLayers -> Examples -> Single Image WMS]:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/layers-view.xml[tags=imageWmsSource]
----

[[vector-layer]]
== VectorLayer

A vector layer is utilized to work with geometries. It’s possible to add multiple vector layers to a map.

[[vector-source]]
=== VectorSource

Source for working with features. For more details see https://openlayers.org/en/v8.2.0/apidoc/module-ol_source_Vector-VectorSource.html[VectorSource documentation^].

The following example demonstrates how to display a vector layer with `VectorSource`. Initially, define a map in the XML descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/layers-view.xml[tags=vectorSource]
----

Subsequently, open the view controller and add the created marker to the map:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/LayersView.java[tags=vectorSource;onInit;mapwithvector]
----
<1> Adds a marker feature to the source.

[[data-vector-source]]
=== DataVectorSource

`DataVectorSource` allows data binding to Jmix data containers through the `dataContainer` and `property` attributes. The `property` attribute can take both simple property and property path.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/location/location-detail-view.xml[tags=geoMap]
----

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<maps:vector id="vectorLayer">
    <maps:dataVectorSource dataContainer="ordersDc"
                           property="customer.address.point"/>
</maps:vector>
----

[[source-with-editable-features]]
=== Source with editable features

Both `VectorSource` and `DataVectorSource` have attributes that enable selection, dragging and feature modification modes.

[[select-mode]]
==== Select mode

To enable feature selection, set `featureSelectEnabled` attribute to `true`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/select-mode-view.xml[tags=select-mode1]
----

This mode enables users to select features on the map by clicking or by using the `Shift` + click combination for multi-selection.

image::layers-select-example.gif[]

NOTE: When select mode is used in combination with drag or modify modes, only the selected features can be dragged or modified.

The select mode provides the select event to handle the selection and deselection of features, refer to xref:maps:events.adoc#_source_events[Source events].

There is also the ability to style the selected features. Refer to the xref:maps:style.adoc#select-mode-styles[Select mode styles] for more details.

[[drag-mode]]
==== Drag mode

To enable feature dragging, set `featureDragEnabled` attribute to `true`. It will enable a control button image:layers-drag-icon.png[] on a map that activates dragging mode.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/drag-mode-view.xml[tags=drag-mode1]
----

Example of enabled drag mode:

image::layers-drag-example.gif[]

The given mode provides events to handle start and end of dragging, refer to xref:maps:events.adoc#_source_events[Source events].

[[modify-mode]]
==== Modify mode

To enable feature modification, set `featureModifyEnabled` attribute to `true`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/maps-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/mapssample/view/layers/modify-mode-view.xml[tags=modify-mode1]
----

It will enable control buttons on the map:

- image:layers-modify-icon.png[] - activates modify mode. This mode renders a vertex that can be dragged to modify a feature or clicked to remove it.
- image:layers-delete-icon.png[] - activates delete mode. When this mode is active, users can click on a feature and a confirmation dialog for deletion will appear.

Example of enabled modify mode:

image::layers-modify-example.gif[]

This mode provides events to handle the start and end of modifications. Additionally, the <<vector-source>> has a delete event. For more information, refer to xref:maps:events.adoc#_source_events[Source events].

There is also the ability to style the generated vertex points. Refer to xref:maps:style.adoc#modify-mode-styles[Modify mode styles] for more details.
