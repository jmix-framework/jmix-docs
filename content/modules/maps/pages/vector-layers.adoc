= Vector Layers

`VectorLayer` is a base layer for displaying entities on the map. It is a data-aware component acting as a connector between data (geo-objects) and a map. Vector layers enable simple displaying, interactive editing, and drawing geo-objects on a map.

== Geo-objects

Geo-object is an entity having a property of a geometry type. This property should have one of the geo-specific datatypes that are included in the `io.jmix.maps.datatype` package:

|===
| *Datatype* | *Java type*
| geoPoint         | org.locationtech.jts.geom.Point
| geoPolyline      | org.locationtech.jts.geom.LineString
| geoPolygon       | org.locationtech.jts.geom.Polygon
|===

To add the property, create a new attribute and select a geo-specific datatype from the list.

Open code of the entity and add the following annotations:

* `@Geometry` — marks that the property is to be used when displaying the geo-object on a map.
+
NOTE: Geo-object must have one geometry property, otherwise an exception will be thrown when drawing the layer.
+
* `@Convert` — allows you to specify a custom JPA converter defining how the datatype will be persisted.
+
NOTE: By default, the add-on uses JPA converters that transform coordinates into the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text[WKT]
format which consequently persists as a text. While loading from DB this text will be parsed back into the objects. These converters are included in the package: `io.jmix.maps.converter.wkt`.

An example of geo-object `Territory`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/maps/ex1/entity/Territory.java[tags=entity-begin;geo-object;entity-end]
----

As you can see, `Territory` is a simple entity, one of which properties `location` is of the `org.locationtech.jts.geom.Polygon` type.

== Binding Geo-Objects to a Layer

To bind geo-objects to a layer, you need to pass a `datacontainer` to the vector layer. This can be declared in the XML descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/maps/ex1/screen/territory/territory-edit.xml[tags=territory-editable]
----

`id` and `dataContainer` are required parameters. Vector layer works with both `InstanceContainer` and `CollectionContainer`.

`editable` parameter defines that the layer can be modified.

NOTE: To edit/draw geometries on the editable vector layer, specify the layer in the `selectedLayer` parameter of the `layers` section.

Additionally, you can create `VectorLayer` in the screen controller:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/maps/ex1/screen/territory/TerritoryEdit.java[tags=map;begin;territory-editable]
----

== Setting Geometry Style

To determine geometry style for geo-objects, use `setStyleProvider()` method. You can also perform this declaratively using the `@Install` annotation in the screen controller, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/maps/ex1/screen/territory/TerritoryEdit.java[tags=geometry-style1;geometry-style2]
----

Use `io.jmix.mapsui.component.layer.style.GeometryStyles` bean to create styles for different geometry types.

== Working with Selected Geo-Objects

Geo-objects can be selected by user click or automatically from the associated data container. If `VectorLayer` is set as selected, it becomes interactive, which means a user can select a geo-object by clicking on it.

`setSelectedGeoObject()` method sets the geo-object which the layer is focused on. For example, if an entity is opened in the editor screen it will be implicitly selected in a corresponding vector layer.

`VectorLayer` is subscribed to changes in the corresponding data container and automatically refreshes when new items are added to the data container or in case of removing items from the container.

Selecting a geo-object produces the `GeoObjectSelectedEvent`. You can subscribe to this event in the screen controller, for example, to select the geo-object in the table:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/maps/ex1/screen/territory/TerritoryBrowse.java[tags=selected]
----

== Clustering

For a vector layer consisting of geo-points it is possible to group nearby points into clusters:

image::maps-clustering.png[]

To enable clustering, add the `cluster` element inside `vector` in the XML descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/maps/ex1/screen/salesperson/salesperson-browse.xml[tags=cluster]
----

You can specify additional clustering options:

* `radius` — maximum radius that a cluster will cover in pixels. The default value is `80`.
* `weightProperty` — if specified, then each point of the layer will have a weight value (int) defined by the weight property of the geo-object.
This value will be used when calculating the summed up value of the cluster (by default, the number of points is used).
* `showCoverage` — shows bounds of the cluster when hovering a mouse over it.
* `disableAtZoom` — specifies a zoom level from which clustering will be disabled.
* `showSinglePointAsCluster` — shows a single point as a cluster of 1 size.

== Working with Underlying Vaadin Components of Geo-objects

For each geo-object displayed on a map, the add-on creates an instance of the `io.jmix.mapsui.component.leaflet.translators.GeoObjectWrapper` class that keeps the underlying Vaadin Component. This class provides methods to work directly with the wrapped component:

 - `openPopup()` — opens the pop-up window of the geo-object if the pop-up content is specified.
 - `closePopup()` — closes the pop-up window of the geo-object.
 - `openTooltip()` — opens the tooltip of the geo-object if the tooltip content is specified.
 - `closeTooltip()` — closes the tooltip of the geo-object.
 - `getLeafletComponent()` — returns the underlying Vaadin Component connected with the Leaflet component on the client side.

To obtain geo-object wrappers for a vector layer, invoke the `getGeoObjectWrappersMap()` method of the `GeoMapImpl` class (implementation of the `GeoMap`) and pass the layer to it:

[source,java]
----
VectorLayer<Territory> territoriesLayer = map.getLayer("territoriesLayer");
Map<?, GeoObjectWrapper<Salesperson>> geoObjectWrappersMap =
        ((GeoMapImpl) map).getGeoObjectWrappersMap(territoriesLayer);
----
The returned map contains entries in which keys are geo-objects IDs (or geo-objects themselves for those whose ID = null) and values are corresponding `GeoObjectWrapper` instances. So you can obtain `GeoObjectWrapper` of the particular geo-object this way:
[source,java]
----
GeoObjectWrapper<Salesperson> geoObjectWrapper = geoObjectWrappersMap.get(salesperson.getId());
if (geoObjectWrapper != null) {
    geoObjectWrapper.openPopup();
}
----
WARNING: If the geometry value of the geo-object is null, then there is no `GeoObjectWrapper` for this geo-object.

Also, be aware that `GeoObjectWrapper` instances can be changed or replaced after refreshing the layer. So always use this map to get the relevant wrapper instance.
