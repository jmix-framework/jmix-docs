= 2. Simple CRUD

Let's start from implementing the simplest feature of your Onboarding application: management of onboarding Steps.

Essentially, an onboarding Step is an action that needs to be done within certain period of time by a new hire. The application stores the name of the action and its maximum duration. A user with admin access rights will manage the list, create new Steps, edit or remove them using dedicated views.  Once created, a Step can be assigned to  employees (User) by HR manager.

The feature will include the following:

* The `Step` entity.
* A database table for the entity.
* CRUD views for working with the entity.

[[create-entity]]
== Creating Step Entity

The entity has just a few simple attributes:

image::simple-crud/step-diagram.svg[align="center"]

If your application is running, stop it using the *Stop* button (image:common/suspend.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

In the *Jmix* tool window, click *New* (image:common/add.svg[]) -> *JPA Entity*:

image::simple-crud/create-entity-1.png[align="center",width=391]

The *New JPA Entity* dialog appears. Enter `Step` into the *Class* field and select the *Traits* -> *Versioned* checkbox:

image::simple-crud/create-entity-2.png[align="center",width=492]

Click *OK*.

Studio will create the entity class and open the entity designer:

image::simple-crud/create-entity-3.png[align="center"]

As you can see, the new entity has two attributes:

* `id` is the identifier required for any entity. It is mapped to the `ID` column, which is the primary key of the database table.
* `version` attribute is added because you have selected the *Versioned* trait for the entity. With the help of this attribute, the framework provides optimistic locking of entity instances. We recommend always using optimistic locking for entities unless you have a good reason not to do it.

Let's add the `name` attribute to the entity.

Click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar.

The *New Attribute* dialog appears. Enter `name` into the *Name* field and select the *Mandatory* checkbox:

image::simple-crud/create-entity-4.png[align="center"]

Take a look at the most important parameters of the attribute:

* *Attribute type* - the `DATATYPE` value means that the attribute is of a simple type like String, Integer, etc.
* *Type* defines the Java type of the attribute.
* *Length* specifies the length of the database column and, in the case of String attributes, the maximum number of characters a user can enter to a corresponding text field in UI.
* When *Mandatory* checkbox is selected, the database column will be created with a non-null constraint and a UI field will require a value.
* *Column* defines a name for the mapped database column.

Click *OK*. The `name` attribute will be added to the attributes list.

Now let's add the `duration` attribute which represents the maximum number of days to complete the step.

Click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar. In the *New Attribute* dialog, enter `duration` into the *Name* field, select `Integer` in the *Type* field and select the *Mandatory* checkbox:

image::simple-crud/create-entity-5.png[align="center"]

Click *OK*. The `duration` attribute will appear in the attributes list.

Finally, add the `sortValue` attribute which will be used for ordering steps. Select `Integer` in the *Type* field and select the *Mandatory* checkbox:

image::simple-crud/create-entity-6.png[align="center"]

The final state of the entity should look like this:

image::simple-crud/create-entity-7.png[align="center"]

You can use the *Up* (image:common/move-up.svg[]) / *Down* (image:common/move-down.svg[]) buttons in the *Attributes* toolbar to reorder the attributes.

Let's look at the resulting entity class generated by the designer. Switch to the *Text* tab at the bottom:

image::simple-crud/create-entity-8.png[align="center"]

If you have an experience with JPA, you will see familiar annotations: `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Column`, etc. There are also a few annotations specific to Jmix. The most important one is `@JmixEntity` on the class header. In general, any POJO can be an entity in Jmix if it is annotated with `@JmixEntity`.

The entity class can be edited manually, and when you switch back to the *Designer* tab, it will reflect the changes. For example, if you remove the `nullable = false` and `@NotNull` from an attribute, the designer will unselect the *Mandatory* checkbox for it.

[[create-views]]
== Creating CRUD Views

When the entity class is ready, you can generate CRUD views for it.

In the actions panel at the top of the entity designer, click *Views* -> *Create view*:

image::simple-crud/create-screens-1.png[align="center", width="457"]

On the first step of the view creation wizard, select the `Entity list and detail views` template:

image::common/screen-wizard-1.png[align="center",width="776"]

Click *Next*.

On the second step, the wizard lets you select the package and names for the generated views:

image::simple-crud/create-screens-3.png[align="center"]

Accept the suggested values and click *Next*.

On the next step, you can set some options for the views:

image::simple-crud/create-screens-4.png[align="center"]

All these options can be modified later in the created views, so just accept the suggested values and click *Next*.

On the next step, the wizard lets you set up the _fetch plan_ for the entity list view:

image::simple-crud/create-screens-5.png[align="center"]

NOTE: In short, a fetch plan determines what attributes and referenced entities must be loaded for the view.

The `Step` entity is very simple, so there is no need to adjust the fetch plan for it. We will take a closer look at fetch plans later when we deal with more complex entities and views.

Click *Next*.

Now the wizard lets you set up the fetch plan for the entity detail view:

image::simple-crud/create-screens-6.png[align="center"]

Again, there is no point in changing the suggested fetch plan - it just includes all attributes.

Click *Next*.

At the final step of the wizard, it lets you set titles for the views:

image::simple-crud/create-screens-7.png[align="center"]

Accept the suggested values and click *Create*.

Studio will generate two views: `Step.list` and `Step.detail` and open their source code.

NOTE: Each view consists of two parts: descriptor and controller. The descriptor is an XML file defining view components and layout. Controller is a Java class that can contain event handlers and other logic.

The XML descriptor of the generated `Step.list` view will be displayed in the Studio view designer:

image::simple-crud/create-screens-8.png[align="center",width="1110"]

The main parts of the designer are highlighted on the picture above. You will take a closer look at them later in this guide.

[[run-app]]
== Running the Application

After creating the entity and CRUD views for it, you can run the application to see the new feature in action.

Click the *Debug* button (image:common/start-debugger.svg[]) in the main toolbar as you did in the xref:project-setup.adoc#run-app[previous section].

Before running the application, Studio checks the difference between the project data model and the database schema. As long as you have created a new entity, Studio generates a Liquibase changelog for the corresponding changes in the database (creating the `STEP` table):

image::simple-crud/run-app-1.png[align="center"]

Click *Save and run*.

Studio will execute the changelog against your database:

image::simple-crud/run-app-2.png[align="center",width="1075"]

After that, Studio builds and runs the application:

image::simple-crud/run-app-3.png[align="center",width="1075"]

When the application is ready, open `++http://localhost:8080++` in your web browser and log in to the application with `admin` / `admin` credentials.

Click on the `Steps` item in the `Application` menu. You will see the `Step.list` view:

image::simple-crud/run-app-4.png[align="center"]

Click *Create*. The `Step.detail` view will open:

image::simple-crud/run-app-5.png[align="center"]

Using the list and detail views, create a few onboarding steps with the following parameters:


|===
|Name |Duration |Sort value

|Safety briefing
|1
|10

|Fill in profile
|1
|20

|Check all functions
|2
|30

|Information security training
|3
|40

|Internal procedures studying

[[summary]]
== Summary

In this section, you have created the simplest feature of the application: onboarding steps management.

You have learned that:

* Studio has a visual designer for creating and editing xref:data-model:entities.adoc[entity] classes and attributes.
* Optimistic locking is recommended for most entities. It is used if you select the *Versioned* xref:data-model:entities.adoc#traits[trait] for the entity.
* Studio can generate CRUD views for an entity by templates.
* An entity list view is added to the main menu of the application.
* Before running the application, Studio compares the data model and the database schema. If there is a difference, it generates and executes a xref:data-model:db-migration.adoc[Liquibase changelog].
