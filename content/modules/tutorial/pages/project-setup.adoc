= 1. Project Setup

In this chapter you will go through a few simple steps to set up a new project. You will learn how to navigate the project structure and locate essential components. Once your project is set up, you will be able to run it and explore its pre-built features.

[[dev-env]]
== Setting Up Development Environment

Install Jmix Studio and JDK as described in the xref:ROOT:setup.adoc[] section if you haven't done it yet.

In this tutorial, we assume that you have a commercial or trial subscription to *Jmix Studio Premium*. The Studio subscription gives access to visual editors and code generation capabilities that save time and help to learn Jmix features.

When you run Jmix Studio for the first time, you should log in to the Jmix account, and after that a trial subscription for 28 days is activated. After it expires, you will be able to use the free version of Studio or purchase a commercial subscription.

[[create-project]]
== Creating Project

Run IntelliJ IDEA with Jmix Studio plugin installed, switch to the *Projects* tab and click *New Project*:

image::project-setup/create-project-1.png[align="center",width="912"]

On the first step of the *New Project* wizard, select *Jmix Project* in the list and leave default values in the *Repository* and *Jmix version* fields:

// todo flowui

image::project-setup/create-project-2.png[align="center",width="912"]

In the *Project JDK* field, select a JDK version 17. If the field displays `<No SDK>`, select *Download JDK* in its dropdown list and follow further instructions to download and select a JDK.

Click *Next*.

On the next step of the *New Project* wizard, select the first project template from the list: `Full-Stack Application (Java)`:

image::project-setup/create-project-3.png[align="center"]

Click *Next*.

On the last step of the *New Project* wizard, enter `onboarding` to the *Project name* field:

image::project-setup/create-project-4.png[align="center"]

The *Base package* field defines the Java package which will contain all classes and resources of the project. Keep the value suggested by the wizard (`com.company.onboarding`) to conform the code in the tutorial.

*Project id* is not required for an application, so leave the field empty.

Click *Create*.

NOTE: After the project is created, IDE starts downloading dependencies and indexing the project. On the first launch, it may take significant time (up to 10 minutes or more, depending on your internet connection and computer power). Please wait until the progress indicator in the status bar disappears.

[TIP]
====
The IDE will show a number of notifications suggesting to download "pre-built shared indexes" and install additional plugins. You can safely refuse them.
====

[[login]]
=== Logging in to Jmix Account

After downloading dependencies and indexing a project for the first time, Studio will show the *Jmix Sign In* dialog. In this dialog, you should log in to your Jmix account or register the new one.

image::project-setup/sign-in-dialog.png[align="center",width="496"]

Click on the *Sign In / Register* button.

image::project-setup/sign-in-your-account-dialog.png[align="center",width="710"]

* If you don't have a Jmix account, click on the *Register* link. In the Registration form, fill in the *First name*, *Last name*, *Email*, and *Password* fields, accept the privacy policy and click on the *Register* button.
+
NOTE: The email address you entered will be used as your login and the primary email address for your account.
+
After you have submitted the registration form, you should verify your email address to activate your account. Find the verification email in your inbox and click the link in the email to finish the registration.
+
Go back to the IDE and click the *Log in* button in the *Email Verification* window.

* If you already have a Jmix account, enter the *Email* and *Password* and click the *Sign In* button.

A new user automatically gets a trial subscription to evaluate the full capabilities of the Studio for 28 days.

image::project-setup/jmix-subscription.png[align="center",width="612"]

When the project is ready, and Jmix Studio is activated, IDE opens the *Jmix* tool window on the left and the *Welcome* page in the working area:

image::project-setup/create-project-5.png[align="center",width="952"]

[TIP]
====
If all progress indicators have disappeared, but you don't see the *Welcome* page and *Jmix* tool window, do the following:

- Open *Gradle* tool window available on the right side of the IDE.
- Click *Reload All Gradle Projects* (image:common/refresh.svg[]) tool button.
====

[[explore-project]]
== Exploring New Project

The *Jmix* tool window presents a structured view of the project. Let's figure out what a newly created project contains.

* In the *Build Scripts* section you can see the Gradle build files:
+
// todo flowui
image::project-setup/explore-project-1.png[align="center",width="954"]

* The *Configuration* section contains the main application class `OnboardingApplication` and the `application.properties` file which defines database connection parameters, logging levels and other properties:
+
// todo flowui
image::project-setup/explore-project-2.png[align="center",width="1007"]

* The *Add-ons* section displays the list of installed Jmix add-ons:
+
image::project-setup/explore-project-3.png[align="center",width="823"]
+
If you double-click on the *Add-ons* node, Studio will open a dialog window for managing add-ons in your project.

* The *Data Stores* section displays the list of databases used in the project, and their Liquibase changelogs:
+
image::project-setup/explore-project-4.png[align="center",width="834"]
+
In the new project, the HSQL relational database is used by default. It stores data in the `.jmix/hsqldb` folder of the project.
+
Liquibase changelogs are XML files describing the database schema changes.
+
If you double-click on the *Main Data Store* node, you will see parameters of the database connection in a dialog window. These parameters are stored in the `application.properties` file.

* The *Data Model* section displays all project entities. There is a single `User` entity in the new project:
+
image::project-setup/explore-project-5.png[align="center",width="814"]

* The *User Interface* section contains the project views, as well as the *Themes* node to manage custom CSS, the *Message Bundle* node for quick access to localized messages and the *Main Menu* node for opening the menu descriptor:
+
image::project-setup/explore-project-6.png[align="center",width="814"]
+
As you can see, the project already contains a few views:

** `LoginView` accepts username and password for user authentication.

** `MainView` opens after login and contains the main menu.

** `User.list` and `User.detail` are CRUD views for the `User` entity. In Jmix, by convention, `list` suffix means a view displaying the list of entities, and `detail` means a view editing a single entity instance.

* The *Beans* section displays Spring beans defined in the project.
+
image::project-setup/explore-project-9.png[align="center",width="814"]

* The *Security* section shows a list of roles. The new project contains the `FullAccessRole` which is assigned to the `admin` user and `UiMinimalRole` which gives minimal permissions to users:
+
image::project-setup/explore-project-7.png[align="center",width="820"]

* The *Deployment* section will let you quickly deploy a containerized application to the cloud:
+
image::project-setup/explore-project-10.png[align="center",width="814"]

* If you double-click on the *Sources* node, Studio will open the *Project* tool window with the usual view of the entire source code:
+
image::project-setup/explore-project-8.png[align="center"]
+
Switch to the *Jmix* tool window by clicking on the tab at the left side of the IDE window.

[[run-app]]
== Running Application from IDE

You can run the new project right after opening it in the IDE and see the initial state of your application.

[[start-app]]
=== Starting Application

image::project-setup/run-app-1.png[align="center"]

Find the dropdown field showing `Onboarding Jmix Application` value in the main toolbar and click the *Debug* button (image:common/start-debugger.svg[]) next to it.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, you may see one more item in the *Run/Debug Configurations* dropdown list, called `OnboardingApplication` and having a Spring Boot icon (image:common/spring-boot.svg[]) on the left. It is automatically added by the Spring Boot plugin bundled with the IDE. Don't use it.

To run a Jmix application, always use a configuration marked with the Gradle icon (image:common/gradle.svg[]).
====

Studio will show the warning about the data store and unapplied changelog files:

image::project-setup/run-app-2.png[align="center"]

What does it mean?

On each start of the application, Studio tries to bring the database schema in sync with the project data model. So when you change your entities and their attributes, Studio will automatically generate Liquibase changelogs for making appropriate changes in the database.

To generate a changelog, Studio needs a current schema to be present in the database. Then it compares the database schema with the current data model and generates a changelog for the difference.

At the moment, our database is empty (actually, in our default case of the file-based HSQL database, it doesn't exist at all), so to generate a diff changelog, Studio first needs to create the database and execute all existing changelogs of the project. In the dialog, you can see the existing changelogs from the project dependencies (marked _read only_) and from the project itself (`010-init-user.xml`).

Click *Execute and proceed*.

You will see the execution of Liquibase changelogs by Studio in the *Run* tool window at the bottom:

image::project-setup/run-app-3.png[align="center"]

All existing changelogs have been executed, Studio has checked the database schema for differences with the data model and found nothing. This is expected: you haven't made any changes in the data model yet.

Right after checking the database, Studio builds and runs the application. You will see the console output of the running application in the *Debug* tool window at the bottom:

image::project-setup/run-app-4.png[align="center"]

When the application is ready to work, you will see the following message in the console : `Application started at ++http://localhost:8080++`

[[enter-app]]
=== Entering Application

Open `localhost:8080` in a web browser. You will see your application login view:

image::project-setup/run-app-5.png[align="center"]

The `admin` / `admin` credentials are already set in the username and password fields (you can remove them later), so just click *Log in*.

In the main menu, click *Application* -> *Users*:

image::project-setup/run-app-6.png[align="center"]

It's the `Users.list` view showing the list of `User`  entities. Now it has only the `admin` user created in the database by the `010-init-user.xml` changelog.

[[stop-app]]
=== Stopping Application

To stop the running application, click *Stop* button (image:common/suspend.svg[]) in the main toolbar:

image::project-setup/run-app-7.png[align="center"]

You will see the following messages in the *Debug* console:

image::project-setup/run-app-8.png[align="center"]

Don't worry, it's not actually an error. This is the expected behavior of the IDE.
