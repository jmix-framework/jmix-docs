= 3. References and Unique Attributes

The next feature of your Onboarding application is the management of Departments.

New hire belongs to a Department. Each department has a unique name and a reference to HR Manager.

In this chapter, you will create:

* The `Department` entity with the link to `User`.
* A database table with a foreign key and a unique constraint.
* CRUD screens including UI component for selecting the related entity.

[[create-entity]]
== Creating Department Entity

The `Department` entity has the `name` (unique) attribute and the `hrManager` attribute which is a reference to the `User` entity:

[plantuml]
....
@startuml

entity Department {
    id
    name
    hrManager: User
}

entity User {
}

Department }- User

@enduml
....

If your application is running, stop it using the *Stop* button (image:common/suspend.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

In the *Jmix* tool window, click *New* (image:common/add.svg[]) -> *JPA Entity* as you did in the xref:simple-crud.adoc#create-entity[previous chapter]. In the *New JPA Entity* dialog, enter `Department` into the *Class* field and select the *Traits* -> *Versioned* checkbox:

image::references/create-entity-1.png[align="center",width=492]

Click *OK*.

Studio will create the entity class and open the entity designer:

image::references/create-entity-2.png[align="center"]

[[create-unique-attr]]
=== Creating Unique Attribute

Let's add the `name` attribute to the entity.

Click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar. In the *New Attribute* dialog, enter `name` into the *Name* field and select the *Mandatory* checkbox:

image::references/create-entity-3.png[align="center"]

Now let's define a unique constraint for the `NAME` column in the database. It will ensure there will be no departments with the same name.

Switch to the *Indexes* tab at the bottom and click *New Index* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Database Indexes* toolbar. Studio will add a row to the indexes list:

image::references/create-entity-4.png[align="center"]

Select `NAME` in the *Available attributes* list and click image:common/arrow-right.svg[] in the toolbar to move it to the *Selected attributes*.

Select the *Unique* and *Constraint* checkboxes in the index row and change the name to `IDX_DEPARTMENT_UNQ_NAME`:

image::references/create-entity-5.png[align="center"]

If you switch to the *Text* tab of the entity designer, you will see the unique constraint added to the `@Table` annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@JmixEntity
@Table(name = "DEPARTMENT", uniqueConstraints = {
        @UniqueConstraint(name = "IDX_DEPARTMENT_UNQ_NAME", columnNames = {"NAME"})
})
@Entity
public class Department {
    // ...
----

Using this annotation, Studio will add a unique constraint for the database table to the Liquibase changelog.

[[create-reference-attr]]
=== Creating Reference Attribute

Now create a reference to an HR Manager of the department.

Click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar. In the *New Attribute* dialog, enter `hrManager` into the *Name* field. Then select:

* *Attribute type*: `ASSOCIATION`
* *Type*: `User`
* *Cardinality*: *Many to One*

image::references/create-entity-6.png[align="center"]

Click *OK*.

You can find the new attribute on the *Text* tab:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@JoinColumn(name = "HR_MANAGER_ID")
@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private User hrManager;
----

Also, the `@Table` annotation on the class header now defines the index for the foreign key column:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@JmixEntity
@Table(name = "DEPARTMENT", indexes = {
        @Index(name = "IDX_DEPARTMENT_HR_MANAGER", columnList = "HR_MANAGER_ID")
    },
    // ...
----

You can see it on the *Indexes* tab too.

[[create-screens]]
== Creating CRUD Screens

Let's generate CRUD screens for the `Department` entity.

Click *Screens* -> *Create screen* in the actions panel at the top of the entity designer:

image::references/create-screens-1.png[align="center", width="475"]

On the first step of the screen creation wizard, select the `Entity browser and editor screen` template:

image::common/screen-wizard-1.png[align="center"]

Click *Next*.

Accept the suggested values on the first two steps of the wizard.

On the *Entity browser fetch plan* step, add the `hrManager` attribute to the selection:

image::references/create-screens-2.png[align="center"]

Now you can be sure that the referenced `User` entity will be loaded together with the root `Department` entity and displayed in the browse screen.

CAUTION: If an attribute is not present in the fetch plan, Studio doesn't create a visual component for it in the generated screens.

Click *Next*.

On the next *Entity editor fetch plan* step, this attribute will be selected automatically:

image::references/create-screens-3.png[align="center"]

Click *Next*.

Accept the values on the *Localizable messages* step and click *Create*.

Studio will generate two screens: `Department.browse` and `Department.edit` and open their source code. Close all editor tabs for now - you will make some changes in the generated screens later in this chapter.

[[run-app]]
== Running the Application

Click the *Debug* button (image:common/start-debugger.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Before running the application, Studio will generate a Liquibase changelog:

image::references/run-app-1.png[align="center"]

As you can see, the changelog contains commands for creating the `DEPARTMENT` table, a unique constraint for the `NAME` column and the foreign key and the index for the `HR_MANAGER_ID` column.

Click *Save and run*.

Studio will execute the changelog, then build and run the application.

Open `++http://localhost:8080++` in your web browser and log in to the application with `admin` / `admin` credentials.

Click on the `Departments` item in the `Application` menu. You will see the `Department.browse` screen:

image::references/run-app-2.png[align="center"]

Click *Create*. The `Department.edit` screen will open:

image::references/run-app-3.png[align="center"]

You can select an HR Manager for the department by clicking the ellipsis button in the picker field. The users browse screen will open over the department editor, which will be indicated by the breadcrumbs. The *Select* button will become active when you select a row in the users table:

image::references/run-app-4.png[align="center"]

Select a user and click *Select*. The user will be displayed in the picker field:

image::references/run-app-5.png[align="center"]

Click *OK*. The referenced user will be displayed in the table too:

image::references/run-app-6.png[align="center"]

[[instance-name]]
=== Observing the Instance Name

You may wonder why the picker field and the table show the `[admin]` string for the selected user?

Jmix has a concept of _instance name_: a human-readable text that represents an entity instance. It can be defined for any entity using the `@InstanceName` annotation on a field or a method.

The `User` entity generated by the project template has the following method defining the instance name:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class User implements JmixUserDetails, HasTimeZone {
    // ...

    @InstanceName
    @DependsOnProperties({"firstName", "lastName", "username"})
    public String getDisplayName() {
        return String.format("%s %s [%s]", (firstName != null ? firstName : ""),
                (lastName != null ? lastName : ""), username).trim();
    }
----

So when the `firstName` and `lastName` are empty, the `User` instance name is `username` in square brackets, which is what you see in the application at the moment.

The Studio entity designer automatically generates the `@InstanceName` annotation if it encounters an appropriately named attribute: `name`, `description`, etc. For example, your `Department` entity has `@InstanceName` on its `name` attribute:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class Department {
    // ...

    @InstanceName
    @Column(name = "NAME", nullable = false)
    @NotNull
    private String name;
----

So the department's name will be displayed in UI if you use a department as a reference in another entity. You will see it later in the tutorial.

The entity designer also helps you to define the instance name manually. You can select an attribute for it or generate a method using the *Instance name* field and the button next to it:

image::references/instance-name-1.png[align="center", width="475"]

[[customize-ui]]
== Simple UI Customizations

The automatically generated CRUD UI for departments looks acceptable, but there are some rough edges that should be fixed.

[[change-attr-caption]]
=== Changing Attribute Caption

Perhaps you have noticed that the generated caption for the `hrManager` attribute is not quite correct: it reads `Hr manager`. Let's change it to `HR Manager`.

Select the `hrManager` attribute in the entity designer and click the globe  (image:common/globe.svg[]) button next to the attribute name:

image::references/change-caption-1.png[align="center"]

The *Localized Message* dialog will appear:

image::references/change-caption-2.png[align="center", width="616"]

Change the text and click *OK*.

You can view and edit all messages of your project if you double-click the *User Interface* -> *Message Bundle* node in the *Jmix* tool window. The message that you have just changed is highlighted below:

image::references/change-caption-3.png[align="center"]

Switch to the application running in your web browser. Close the department CRUD screens and open them again. You will see the new caption for the `hrManager` attribute.

[TIP]
====
Thanks to the Studio _hot deploy_ feature, you don't have to restart the application when making changes in the UI.

Just save the changes in the IDE (press `Ctrl/Cmd+S`), wait a couple of seconds and reopen the screen.
====

NOTE: Note that refreshing the web browser page doesn't update the UI because the UI state resides on the server. To reopen a screen, close its tab inside the application and open it again from the main menu or from another screen.


[[customize-entity-picker-actions]]
=== Customizing EntityPicker Actions

By default, when you click the ellipsis button of the HR Manager picker field, the screen for selecting a user completely covers the department editor. Let's change the picker behavior to display the users screen in a dialog window.

Find `department-edit.xml` in the *Jmix* tool window and double-click it. The screen designer appears:

image::references/customize-ui-1.png[align="center",width="1109"]

Depending on your display resolution, you may want to show only the XML editor or the preview at a time. Use the buttons on top of the editor panel to switch the mode:

image::references/customize-ui-2.png[align="center", width="667"]

Switch to the *Editor and Preview* mode. Locate `hrManagerField` in the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel. The component will be selected in the preview, in the XML editor and in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel in the lower right corner:

image::references/customize-ui-3.png[align="center", width="1153"]

You can see that the `entityPicker` element has the `actions` nested element with two actions. Each action corresponds to a button of the picker field: the `entityLookup` action shows a screen for selecting the referenced entity, the `entityClear` action clears the current picker value.

The actions can be customized by specifying properties.

Select the `entityLookup` action in the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel, then select the `DIALOG` value from the drop-down list of the `openMode` property in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel:

image::references/customize-ui-4.png[align="center",width="1154"]

Your changes will be reflected in XML.

TIP: It works in the opposite direction too. You can edit the XML directly and view the results in the designer panels and Preview.

Switch to the running application. Select a department and click *Edit* to open the Department editor screen. Then click the ellipsis button in the HR Manager field.

Notice that the users lookup screen now opens in the movable dialog:

image::references/customize-ui-5.png[align="center"]

[[change-unique-constraint-message]]
=== Changing Unique Constraint Violation Message

If you try to create another department with the same name, you will see the error message about the unique constraint violation:

image::references/customize-ui-8.png[align="center"]

The default message is not very user-friendly, but you can easily change it.

Double-click the *User Interface* -> *Message Bundle* node in the *Jmix* tool window and add the following line:

[source,properties]
----
databaseUniqueConstraintViolation.IDX_DEPARTMENT_UNQ_NAME=A department with the same name already exists
----

The message key should start with `databaseUniqueConstraintViolation.` and end with the name of the database unique constraint. You may notice that the file already contains a similar message for the unique constraint on the `username` attribute of the `User` entity.

Switch to the application and test your changes. Now the error shows your message:

image::references/customize-ui-9.png[align="center"]

[[summary]]
== Summary

In this section, you have built the second feature: management of departments.

You have learned that:

* Studio helps to create reference attributes and generates xref:data-model:db-migration.adoc[Liquibase changelogs] with a foreign key and an index.

* To show a reference attribute in a browse or edit screen, it should be included in the xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#fetch-plan[fetch plan] of the screen.

* The xref:data-model:entities.adoc#instance-name[instance name] is used to show a reference in UI.

* The xref:ui:vcl/components/entity-picker.adoc[] component is used by default to select a reference in a generated edit screen. Its xref:ui:actions/standard-actions.adoc#picker-actions[actions] can be customized, for example to show a lookup screen in a dialog window.

* The xref:data-model:entities.adoc#uniqueness[uniqueness of entity attributes] is maintained on the database level by defining unique constraints.

* A unique constraint violation message can be easily xref:ui:exception-handlers/unique-constraint-violation-exception.adoc[customized].

* Captions and messages generated by Studio are stored in the xref:localization:message-bundles.adoc[message bundle] of the application.

* Studio xref:studio:hot-deploy.adoc[hot deploys] changes in screens and messages to the running application, which saves from restarting the application when developing UI. Changes in entities are not hot deployed.
