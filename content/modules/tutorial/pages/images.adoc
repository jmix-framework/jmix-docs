= 6. Working with Images

In this chapter, you will add the `picture` attribute to the `User` entity and learn how to upload and display images in UI.

[[file-ref-attr]]
== Adding File Reference Attribute

Jmix allows you to store uploaded files outside the database in a so-called _file storage_. In the simple case, it's just a file system directory with a special structure. To link the file located in the file storage to an entity, you create an attribute of the `FileRef` type.

Let's create such an attribute for managing the user picture.

If your application is running, stop it using the *Stop* button (image:common/suspend.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Double-click on the `User` entity in *Jmix* tool window and select the `joiningDate` attribute (to add the new attribute after it).

Click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar. In the *New Attribute* dialog, enter `picture` into the *Name* field and select `FileRef` in the *Type* dropdown:

image::images/attribute-2.png[align="center", width="862"]

Accept the suggested value (1024) in the *Length* field. For `FileRef` attribute it defines the column length for storing a reference, not the file itself, so it doesn't limit the file size.

Click *OK*.

Select the `picture` attribute and click the *Add to Views* (image:common/add-attribute-to-screens.svg[]) button in the *Attributes* toolbar.

The appeared dialog window will show all views that display the `User` entity. Select `User.detail` view and click *OK*.

Studio will create the `pictureField` component in the `formLayout` of the `User.detail` view:

[source,xml]
----
<formLayout id="form" dataContainer="userDc">
    ...
    <fileStorageUploadField id="pictureField" property="picture"/>
</formLayout>
----

Click the *Debug* button (image:common/start-debugger.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Before running the application, Studio will generate a Liquibase changelog:

image::images/run-app-1.png[align="center"]

As you can see, the changelog contains a command for adding the `PICTURE` column to the `USER_` table. The column is of type `VARCHAR(1024)`, because the file reference is actually a string.

Click *Save and run*.

Studio will execute the changelog, then build and run the application.

Open `++http://localhost:8080++` in your web browser and log in to the application with `admin` / `admin` credentials.

Click on the `Users` item in the `Application` menu.

Click *Edit* for a user. The UI control for uploading a picture is shown on the form:

image::images/run-app-3.png[align="center"]

[[image-in-form]]
== Displaying Image in Form

In this section, you will improve the detail view to display the uploaded picture in the form.

First, let's wrap `fileStorageUpload` into the collapsible `Details` layout:

image::images/form-1.gif[]

Now the field is located not immediately in the `formLayout` which defines the data container for its nested components, so set the `dataContainer` to the field explicitly:

image::images/form-4.png[align="center",width="338"]

Then add the `image` component below `fileStorageUpload` with the following attributes:

[source,xml]
----
<details summaryText="Picture">
    <hbox>
        <fileStorageUploadField id="pictureField" dataContainer="userDc" property="picture"/>
        <image id="image" property="picture" dataContainer="userDc" height="10em" width="10em"
            classNames="user-picture"/>
    </hbox>
</details>
----

* `dataContainer="userDc" property="picture"` attributes bind the `image` component to the `picture` attribute of the `User` entity.
* `classNames="user-picture"` refers to CSS class defined below.

Open `onboarding.css` file from the *User Interface* -> *Themes* section and define the `user-picture` class:

image::images/form-5.png[align="center",width="680"]

`object-fit: contain` property makes sure the image fills the whole allocated area but keeps the proportions.

[source,css]
----
.user-picture {
    object-fit: contain;
}
----

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application. Refresh the User detail view and try to upload an image:

image::images/form-2.png[align="center"]

[[image-in-table]]
== Displaying Image in Data Grid

Let's create the column to render the image in the data grid of the `User.list` view.

Open `user-list-view.xml` and add the following column to `usersDataGrid`:

[source,xml]
----
<columns resizable="true">
    <column key="picture" sortable="false" flexGrow="0" resizable="false"/>
----

Add the following fields to the `UserListView` class:

[source,java]
----
@ViewComponent
private DataGrid<User> usersDataGrid;

@Autowired
private UiComponents uiComponents;

@Autowired
private FileStorage fileStorage;
----

TIP: You can use *Inject* button in the top actions panel of the editor to inject dependencies into view controllers and Spring beans.

Select the `picture` column in component inspector, switch to the *Handlers* tab and create the `renderer` handler method. Implement the method as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Supply(to = "usersDataGrid.picture", subject = "renderer")
private Renderer<User> usersDataGridPictureRenderer() {
    return new ComponentRenderer<>(user -> { // <1>
        FileRef fileRef = user.getPicture();
        if (fileRef != null) {
            Image image = uiComponents.create(Image.class);  // <2>
            image.setWidth("30px");
            image.setHeight("30px");
            StreamResource streamResource = new StreamResource(
                    fileRef.getFileName(),
                    () -> fileStorage.openStream(fileRef));
            image.setSrc(streamResource); // <3>
            image.setClassName("user-picture");

            return image; // <4>
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    });
}
----
<1> The method returns a `Renderer` object that creates a UI component to be rendered in the column. The renderer receives an entity instance for the current row.
<2> The `Image` component instance is created using the `UiComponents` factory.
<3> The image component gets its content from the file storage by the reference stored in the `picture` attribute of the `User` entity.
<4> The renderer returns the visual component to be shown in the column cells.

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application. Refresh the User list view. You will see the user's picture in the first table column:

image::images/table-3.png[]

[[summary]]
== Summary

In this section, you have added the ability to upload and show a user's picture.

You have learned that:

* xref:files:uploading-files.adoc[Uploaded files] can be stored in a xref:files:file-storage.adoc[file storage] and linked with entities using attributes of the `FileRef` type.

* The xref:flow-ui:vc/components/fileStorageUploadField.adoc[] component allows you to upload files, save them into the file storage and link to an entity attribute.

* The `image` component can display images saved in the file storage.
