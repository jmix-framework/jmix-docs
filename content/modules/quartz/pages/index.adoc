= Quartz

This add-on allows you to manage https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/[Quartz^] jobs via user interface:

* Create new Quartz jobs from the existing implementation of `org.quartz.Job` interface.
* Pause and resume jobs execution.
* Trigger immediate execution of inactive jobs.
* Edit job triggers and parameters.
* Delete jobs.

[[installation]]
== Installation

For automatic installation through Jmix Marketplace, follow instructions in the xref:ROOT:add-ons.adoc#installation[Add-ons] section.

For manual installation, add the following dependencies to your `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
implementation 'io.jmix.quartz:jmix-quartz-starter'
implementation 'io.jmix.quartz:jmix-quartz-flowui-starter'
----

[NOTE]
====
If URL of your main database is set as variable replacing the whole URL (e.g. `main.datasource.url = $\{DB_URL\}`)
you may need to explicitly set the proper driver delegate class via `spring.quartz.properties.org.quartz.jobStore.driverDelegateClass` application property.

Value depends on your database:

* *PostgreSQL*: `org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.PostgreSQLDelegate`
* *Oracle*: `org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.oracle.OracleDelegate`
* *MS SQL*: `org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.MSSQLDelegate`
* Other database: skip this step - default value will be used

If variable within `main.datasource.url` property doesn't include database prefix (e.g. `main.datasource.url = jdbc:postgresql://$\{DB_HOST\}/$\{DB_NAME\}`)
or there are no variables at all - driver delegate class will be resolved automatically and this step can be skipped.

[[usage]]
== Usage

To create and schedule a job for execution, do the following:

. Create a class implementing the `org.quartz.Job` interface. It's `execute()` method will be invoked by the scheduler. For example:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/quartz/ex1/app/SampleJob.java[]
----
+
In the job class, you can inject Spring beans with `@Autowired`.

. Run the application, open *Quartz -> Quartz jobs* view and click *Create*.
+
--
** Enter an arbitrary unique name in the *Name* field and select your job class in the *Class* field.
+
The *Group* field is optional but can be used to group jobs in UI.

** Create at least one trigger for the job on the *Triggers* tab. You can select either *Cron expression* or *Simple* schedule type. In the former case, enter a http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html[Cron expression^] like `0/5 * * ? * * *` (each 5 sec). In the latter case, enter a repeat interval in milliseconds.
--
+
After you save the trigger and the job, it is immediately scheduled for execution according to the trigger settings.
+
To edit the job settings, first pause it by selecting and clicking *Pause*. After saving changes, you can resume the scheduling by clicking *Resume*.
+
You can also execute any registered job immediately by clicking *Execute now*, even if the job has no triggers. This is useful for testing.

[[authentication]]
=== Authentication in Jobs

The code executed by the scheduler is not authenticated, that is not associated with any user.

If you invoke operations that require authentication, for example working with data through `DataManager`, use xref:security:authentication.adoc#system[SystemAuthenticator] or `@Authenticated` annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/quartz/ex1/app/SampleAuthenticatedJob.java[tags=auth-job]
----

TIP: You can also use `UnconstrainedDataManager` to work with data in unauthenticated contexts.

[[job-parameters]]
=== Job Parameters

The *Job editor* view allows you to set parameters for the job instance on the *Job data parameters* tab. You can use the parameters in the job class as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/quartz/ex1/app/SampleParameterizedJob.java[tags=job-params]
----

[[track-job-execution]]
=== Tracking Job Execution

If you want to track execution of jobs, create a bean implementing the `JobListener` interface or extending the `JobListenerSupport` as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/quartz/ex1/app/JobExecutionListener.java[]
----
<1> Invoked by Spring after the bean is instantiated.
<2> Invoked by Quartz scheduler after a job is executed.

In the `jobWasExecuted()` method, you can store information about the executed job in the log or in the database.
