= Importing and Exporting Reports

The Jmix Reports add-on provides features to handle the export and import of report definitions directly from the UI and programmatically.

[[manually]]
== Manually

The Reports add-on allows you to manually import and export reports directly from the *Reports* view by clicking the *Import* and *Export* buttons. See xref:report-view.adoc#export-import[Report List View] for more information.

[[report-import-export]]
== Using ReportImportExport

The Jmix Reports add-on provides the `ReportImportExport` API which allows you to import ZIP files with exported reports.

Consider the example of automated report deployment within a Jmix project. The reports have been manually exported and saved as ZIP archives to the project's resources directory.

<1> The `DemoDataInitializer` bean is responsible for triggering the report import on application startup.
<2> This method is automatically invoked when the `ApplicationStartedEvent` is published. We'll put our initialization logic in here. `ApplicationStartedEvent` is a Spring event that is published after the entire application has been initialized and is ready to process requests. It signals the successful startup of your Jmix application.
<3> `DemoDataInitializer` utilizes an `InitFlags` entity to persist a flag thatâ€™s set to `true` after the initial import. This flag uses a pessimistic database lock to avoid concurrent execution when multiple servers in a cluster are starting up. Moreover, you have the flexibility to define alternative conditions for report creation/updates or even trigger `ReportImportExport` via a manual command in the application's user interface.
<4> The `ReportImportExport` bean handles the actual report import.
