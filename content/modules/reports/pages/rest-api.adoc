= REST API
:page-aliases: reports:api.adoc

The Reports add-on REST API provides the following functions:

* Getting a list of reports.

* Getting the details on a specific report.

* Running a report and getting the result.

* Getting the details on a specific report group.

* Getting Swagger documentation.

Reports REST API uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication in the same way as xref:rest:access-control.adoc[Generic REST].

To enable REST API for reports, make sure your `build.gradle` contains the following dependencies:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/build.gradle[tags=reports-rest]
----

To make a report available through the REST API, select the *Available through REST API* checkbox on the xref:reports:creation/details.adoc[Report details] tab.

Below we provide a formal description of some features specific to the Reports add-on. For more information on how to get an OAuth token and other REST API features, see REST API add-on xref:rest:index.adoc[documentation].
