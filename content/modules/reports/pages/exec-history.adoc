[[execution_history]]
= Report Execution History

The Reports add-on provides a mechanism of a report execution history management with the following features:

. Save execution history for each report. The system administrator can use the report execution history to find out how often a report is executed, how much processing time is spent on a report, by which user and when a report was run, what errors occurred during the execution.
. Clean outdated report execution history.

The report execution history is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the xref:configuration.adoc#jmix.reports.historyRecordingEnabled[jmix.reports.historyRecordingEnabled] application property to `true`.

The execution history view is considered administrative and was not added to the main menu. To view the execution history, go to the report list view (the *Reports* -> *Reports* menu item), select some report, and click on the *Execution history* button.

[[execution_history_action]]
== Execution History Action

You can open execution history in any view using `ShowExecutionReportHistoryAction` and an associated button or a component context menu item.

`io.jmix.reportsflowui.action.ShowExecutionReportHistoryAction` - a xref:flow-ui:actions/standard-actions.adoc[standard action] for displaying the report execution history. It should be defined for a `Button` or a list component (`DataGrid`, `TreeDataGrid`).

Below is an example of using the declarative action for the `DataGrid`:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/resources/com/company/library/view/literaturetype/literature-type-list-view.xml[tags=buttonsPanel;historyBtn;dataGrid;actions;showHistory]
----
<1> Add a button with report history action.
<2> The `type` attribute defines a specific `report_showExecutionReportHistory` action type, provided by the framework.

Example of programmatically creating the action together with a button declared in the view XML descriptor:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/java/com/company/library/view/literaturetype/LiteratureTypeListView.java[tags=historyBtn;actions;onInit;ShowExecutionReportHistoryAction]
----

When the action is performed, a modal **Execution history** dialog will open where reports related to the current view will be displayed. After clicking on the **Execution History** button, the execution history for the selected reports will be displayed.

//TODO новая картинка, не открывается пока - пустая!
//image::report_execution_history.png[align="center"]

"Cancelled" flag means that the user launched the report as a background task, and then canceled it.

Execution history is also recorded even for reports which are not yet saved to the database, but launched from the report detail view (by clicking the *Run* button).

[[history_output_documents]]
== Output Documents

The mechanism provides an ability to save output documents - report results files - in the xref:files:index.adoc[file storage]. This feature consumes a file storage disk space; it is configured separately and is disabled by default. To enable it, define the xref:configuration.adoc#jmix.reports.saveOutputDocumentsToHistory[jmix.reports.saveOutputDocumentsToHistory] application property to `true`:

[source, properties,indent=0]
----
jmix.reports.saveOutputDocumentsToHistory = true
----

Now, if you select an item in the execution history table, the *Download document* button becomes available. Click the button to download a document that is a report result file.

Reports with xref:creation/templates.adoc#table_output[table] output type do not have result files, so the execution history of such reports does not save any output documents.

If you run the report programmatically using the `createAndSaveReport()` method, it saves another copy of the same result document to the file storage. These two files are put to the file storage independently.

[[execution_history_cleanup]]
== History Cleanup

You can use Quartz Job Scheduler to clean up the report execution history periodically.

. Include Quartz add-on in your project as described in the xref:quartz:index.adoc#installation[Quartz / Installation] section.

. Create a job class and call `ReportExecutionHistoryRecorder.cleanupHistory()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/java/com/company/library/app/ReportHistoryCleanJob.java[tags=quartz]
----

. In the running application, open the *Quartz -> Quartz jobs* view, and configure a job for the `ReportHistoryCleanJob` class.

. Alternatively, if you want to configure the job at development time, add the following beans to the main application class:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/java/com/company/library/LibraryApplication.java[tags=quartz]
----
+
<1> Schedule for nightly, for example, `0 0 1 * * ?`

. Set up the report history cleanup configuration properties:
+
* xref:configuration.adoc#jmix.reports.historyCleanupMaxDays[jmix.reports.historyCleanupMaxDays] - 730 days by default.
* xref:configuration.adoc#jmix.reports.historyCleanupMaxItemsPerReport[jmix.reports.historyCleanupMaxItemsPerReport] - 1000 by default.

When the report execution history is cleaned up, the associated output document is also deleted from the file storage.
