== Sample XLS Report

The example is based on the sample *Library* application, please follow the xref:quick-start.adoc#project_setup_report[instruction] to set up your project then create entities and screens.

In this example, we will generate a report for a book author. Given an author, the report will list his books, the publisher of each book, in which library department the book was stored, and how many books were stored in each department. The result looks like this:

.Books by author
image::sample1_result.png[align="center"]

. xref:creation/data-structure.adoc[Report data structure].
+
--
.Report data structure
image::sample1_structure.png[align="center"]

Let us consider report bands.

* *header* band – report header. It contains the dataset with the Groovy script which outputs the report xref:creation/parameter-and-format.adoc#parameters[external parameters] values:
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
[['authorName' : (params['author'].firstName + ' ' + params['author'].lastName)]]
----

* The *book* band outputs the list of books by running the following SQL query:
+
[source, sql,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/sample_xls.sql[tags=book-dataset]
----
+
This query uses the external report parameter – `author`. The parameter has the *Entity* type, however, in SQL queries you can compare it directly with entity identifier fields; the conversion will be done automatically.

* The *publisher* band, which is a child band of the *book*, outputs the book publishers by running the following SQL query:
+
[source, sql,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/sample_xls.sql[tags=publisher-dataset]
----
+
This query uses the parent band field `++book_id++` as a parameter. This provides dependency between the parent and child bands.

* The *publication* band, which is a child of the *publisher* band, outputs the book publications by running the following SQL query:
+
[source, sql,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/sample_xls.sql[tags=publication-dataset]
----
+
This query uses both parent bands fields as parameters – `++book_id++` and `++publisher_id++`.
--

. Report xref:creation/parameter-and-format.adoc#parameters[parameters].
+
The *Parameters and Formats* tab contains one declared report external parameter – `Author`:
+
.Report parameters
image::sample1_param.png[align="center"]
+
When running the report, the user will have to enter this parameter. The author selection will be performed via the `Author.browse` screen, available in the application.

. Report xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_xls[templates].
+
The *Templates* tab contains a single defined XLS template, loaded from link:{attachmentsdir}/BooksByAuthor.xls[BooksByAuthor.xls]
+
.Report templates
image::sample1_template.png[align="center"]

. Report Name xref:creation/localization.adoc[Localization].
+
The *Localization* tab contains the report name for the Russian locale:
+
[source, properties,indent=0]
----
ru = Книги по автору
----

You can run the report from the generic browser in the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* screen.

[[crosstab_xls]]
== Sample Crosstab Report

The example is based on the sample *Library* application, please follow the xref:quick-start.adoc#project_setup_report[instruction] to set up your project then create entities and screens.

In this example, we will create a crosstab report for the library departments, to list how many books each department purchased every month. The report is extended both vertically and horizontally and aggregates the book amounts for each department and each month:

.Crosstab result
image::crosstab_result.png[align="center"]

To create the report, add a band and select *Crosstab* band orientation on the xref:creation/data-structure.adoc[Report structure] tab of the report editor. This orientation automatically adds three datasets to the band:

. `<band_name>`*_dynamic_header* – the data from this dataset is copied to the right like a vertical band with table columns header.

. `<band_name>`*_master_data* – the data from this dataset is copied downwards like a horizontal band with table rows header.

. `<band_name>` – the dataset named the same as the band, it belongs to. It is the main content band that will fulfill the matrix cells.

These datasets can have any of available dataset types: xref:creation/data-structure.adoc#structure_sql[SQL], xref:creation/data-structure.adoc#structure_jpql[JPQL], xref:creation/data-structure.adoc#structure_groovy[Groovy], and so on.

For example, a crosstab report for the `BookInstance` entity of the *Library* sample application has the following structure:

.Crosstab Report
image::crosstab_structure.png[align="center"]

. Report data xref:creation/data-structure.adoc[structure]. There are three datasets:
+
* The `bi_dynamic_header` dataset will return the list of months names:
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
.bi_dynamic_header dataset
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/sample_crosstab.groovy[]
----
+
* The `bi_master_data` dataset returns names and identifiers of the library departments selected by the user as an xref:creation/parameter-and-format.adoc#parameters[external report parameter]:
+
[source, sql,indent=0]
.bi_master_data dataset
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/sample_crosstab.sql[tags=master-data-dataset]
----
+
* The `bi` dataset will provide data for the matrix cells, which is the book amounts sum for the particular month and department. It takes `bi_master_data@department_id` (the department id) as the vertical coordinate of the cell, and `bi_dynamic_header@header_id` (the month name) as the horizontal coordinate, and fills the matrix cell with the `amount` value.
+
In the example below the report has two more external parameters: the `start_date` and the `end_date` that define the range of book instance creation dates. It would be a good idea to set up xref:creation/parameter-and-format.adoc#report_parameter_validation[cross-parameter validation] to make sure the range makes sense.
+
[source, sql,indent=0]
.bi dataset
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/sample_crosstab.sql[tags=bi-dataset]
----

. Report xref:creation/parameter-and-format.adoc#parameters[parameters].
+
The *Parameters and Formats* tab contains three declared report external parameters – `selected_departments`, `start_date`, `end_date`:
+
.Report parameters
image::crosstab_external_params.png[align="center"]
+
When running the report, the user will have to enter these parameters. The department selection will be performed via the `jmxrpr_LibraryDepartment.browse` screen, available in the application.

. Report xref:creation/templates.adoc[template].
+
Then you can create a XLS report template using Microsoft Office or LibreOffice.
+
The link:{attachmentsdir}/DepartmentBooks.xls[DepartmentBooks.xls] is an example of a template which outputs the list of `Departments` vertically and `Books` for each department horizontally grouped by the months the books were created.
+
This report template contains xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_xls_regions[named regions] for all three datasets of the crosstab band and, additionally, the named region for the column header: `<band_name>_header`. In our case it is `bi_header`.

You can run the report from the generic browser in the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* screen.

[[example_jasper]]
== Sample JasperReports Report

The example is based on the sample *Library* application, please follow the xref:quick-start.adoc#project_setup_report[instruction] to set up your project then create entities and screens.

In this example, we will create a JRXML report to display the list of book publications in the selected department:

.Report result
image::sample_jasper_result.png[align="center"]

. xref:creation/data-structure.adoc[Report data structure].
+
--
.Report data structure
image::sample_jasper_structure.png[align="center"]

Let's consider report bands.

* *Header* band – report header. It contains the dataset with the Groovy script which outputs the report xref:creation/parameter-and-format.adoc#parameters[external parameters] value:
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
[['library_department_name' : params['library_department'].name]]
----

* *Data* band outputs the list of book instances in the department passed as a parameter by running the following Groovy script:
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/sample_jasper.groovy[]
----
+
This query uses the external report parameter – `library_department`. The parameter has the *Entity* type, however you can compare it directly with entity identifier fields; the conversion will be done automatically.
--

. Report xref:creation/parameter-and-format.adoc[parameters].
+
The *Parameters and Formats* tab contains one declared report external parameter – `Department`:
+
.Report parameters
image::sample_jasper_paramters.png[align="center"]
+
When running the report, the user will have to enter this parameter. The department selection will be performed via the `jmxrpr_LibraryDepartment.browse` screen, available in the application.

. Report xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_jasper[template].
+
--
Create the new JRXML file or download link:{attachmentsdir}/BookAvailability.jrxml[BookAvailability.jrxml] with the following content:

[source, xml,indent=0]
.BookAvailability.jrxml
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/BookAvailability.jrxml[]
----

The table in this template is bound to a subDataset. The `title` element uses the *Header* band data directly. You can open the template file in JasperReports visual designer to see the report layout.

Upload the new template to the application, selecting any output type, and make it default:

.Report templates
image::sample_jasper_template.png[align="center"]
--

You can run the report from the generic browser in the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* screen.

[[example_html]]
== Sample HTML/PDF Report with Paging, Headers and Footers

The example is based on the sample *Library* application, please follow the xref:quick-start.adoc#project_setup_report[instruction] to set up your project then create entities and screens.

In this example, we now want to create a report about book summaries with landscape orientation, page numbers, fixed header and footer on each page, configured using special CSS rules and properties. The output format is HTML exported to PDF:

.Report result
image::example_html_result.png[align="center"]

. The report data xref:creation/data-structure.adoc[structure]
+
--
Let's create a simple report without parameters. The JPQL query will select all books with their local attributes: `name` and `summary`.

.Report data structure
image::example_html_structure.png[align="center"]
--

. Report xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_html[template].

+
--
Now let's create the report template file. Here we define header and footer blocks that will be printed on each PDF page. Also we use special `page-break-before`: `always` CSS property. It will generate a page break before each book info block.

As you can see, we use *FreeMarker* statements to insert data to our template. See complete FreeMarker reference https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/[documentation^].

[source, html,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/BookSummary.html[tags=html-body]
----
--

. CSS rules
+
--
We will use the following CSS code to set header/footer postions:

[source, css,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/BookSummary.html[tags=hf-css]
----

And following CSS code to tune our PDF page representation, as well as paddings of the main content to prevent content and header/footer overlapping:

[source, css,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/BookSummary.html[tags=body-css]
----

So, the complete link:{attachmentsdir}/BookSummary.html[BookSummary.html] file will look as below:

[source, html,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/BookSummary.html[tags=**]
----
--

. Create the report template, here we select *Freemarker* template type:
+
--
.Template editor
image::example_html_template.png[align="center"]

You can run the report from the generic browser in the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* screen.
--

[[example_html_groovy_template]]
== HTML Report with Groovy Template Engine

The example is based on the sample *Library* application, please follow the xref:quick-start.adoc#project_setup_report[instruction] to set up your project then create entities and screens.

Let’s create a report that displays the list of book publications for the selected town. The output format is HTML:

.Report result
image::html_groovy_result.png[align="center"]

. Create a report with JPQL dataset:
+
.Report data structure
image::html_groovy_structure.png[align="center"]
+
The `BookPublications` band outputs the list of book's publications by running the following JPQL query:
+
[source, sql,indent=0]
.BookPublications dataset
----
select
b.name as "book",
p.name as "publisher"
from jmxrpr_BookPublication bp
left join bp.book b
left join bp.publisher p
 where bp.town.id = ${town}
----
+
This query uses the external report parameter – `town`. The parameter has the *Entity* type; however, in JPQL queries you can compare it directly with entity identifier fields; the conversion will be done automatically.

. Describe the report xref:creation/parameter-and-format.adoc[parameter]:
+
The *Parameters and Formats* tab contains one declared report external parameter – `Town`:
+
.The report parameter
image::html_groovy_parameter.png[align="center"]
+
When running the report, the user will have to enter this parameter. The town selection will be performed via the `jmxrpr_Town.browse` screen, available in the application.

. Create a report xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_html[template]
+
Create the new HTML file or download link:{attachmentsdir}/PublicationByTown.html[PublicationByTown.html] with the following content:
+
[source, html,indent=0]
.PublicationsTemplate
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/PublicationByTown.html[tags=**]
----
+
The value of the input parameter is used to generate the report title: `${Root.fields.town.name}`.
+
The variable `bookPublications` is defined below:
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/PublicationByTown.html[tags=bookPublications]
----
+
This variable is used in the table's body to display the report fields.
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/docrefs/PublicationByTown.html[tags=report-fields]
----
+
Upload the new template to the application, select HTML output type, select *Groovy template* in the *Template type* radiobutton and make it default:
+
.Report template editor
image::html_groovy_template.png[align="center"]

You can run the report from the generic browser in the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* screen.
