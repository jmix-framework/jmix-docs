== Sample XLS Report

The example is based on the sample *Library* application, please follow the xref:getting-started.adoc#project_setup_report[instruction] to set up your project then create entities and views.

In this example, we will generate a report for a book author. Given an author, the report will list his books, the publisher of each book, in which library department the book was stored, and how many books were stored in each department. The result looks like this:

Let us consider report bands.

* *header* band - report header. It contains the dataset with the Groovy script which outputs the report xref:creation/parameters.adoc[external parameters] values:
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
return [['authorName' : (params['author'].firstName + ' ' + params['author'].lastName)]]
----

* The *book* band outputs the list of books by running the following SQL query:
+
[source,sql,indent=0]
----
select b.name as book_name, b.id as book_id
from BOOK b
    join BOOK_AUTHOR_LINK ba on ba.book_id = b.id
    join AUTHOR a on a.id = ba.author_id
where a.id = ${author}
----
+
This query uses the external report parameter - `author`. The parameter has the *Entity* type, however, in SQL queries you can compare it directly with entity identifier fields; the conversion will be done automatically.

* The *publisher* band, which is a child band of the *book*, outputs the book publishers by running the following SQL query:
+
[source,sql,indent=0]
----
select p.name as publisher, bp.year_, p.id as publisher_id
from BOOK_PUBLICATION bp
    join PUBLISHER p on p.id = bp.publisher_id
where bp.book_id = ${book.book_id}
----
+
This query uses the parent band field `++book_id++` as a parameter. This provides dependency between the parent and child bands.

* The *publication* band, which is a child of the *publisher* band, outputs the book publications by running the following SQL query:
+
[source, sql,indent=0]
----
select ld.name as department, sum(bi.book_count) as amount
from BOOK_INSTANCE bi
    join BOOK_PUBLICATION bp on bp.id = bi.book_publication_id
    join LIBRARY_DEPARTMENT ld on ld.id = bi.library_department_id
where bp.publisher_id = ${publisher.publisher_id} and bp.book_id = ${book.book_id}
group by ld.name
----
+
This query uses both parent bands fields as parameters - `++book_id++` and `++publisher_id++`.
--

. Report xref:creation/parameters.adoc[parameters].
+
The *Parameters* tab contains one declared report external parameter - `Author`:
+
image::sample1-param.png[align="center",width="642"]
+
When running the report, the user will have to enter this parameter. The author selection will be performed via the `Author.list` view, available in the application.

. Report xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_xls[templates].
+
The *Templates* tab contains a single defined XLS template, loaded from link:{attachmentsdir}/BooksByAuthor.xls[BooksByAuthor.xls]
+
image::sample1-template.png[align="center",width="641"]

You can run the report from the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* view.

[[crosstab_xls]]
== Sample Crosstab Report

The example is based on the sample *Library* application, please follow the xref:getting-started.adoc#project_setup_report[instruction] to set up your project then create entities and views.

In this example, we will create a crosstab report for the library departments, to list how many books each department purchased every month. The report is extended both vertically and horizontally and aggregates the book amounts for each department and each month:

image::crosstab_result.png[align="center"]

To create the report, add a band and select *Crosstab* band orientation on the xref:creation/bands.adoc[Bands] tab of the report detail view. This orientation automatically adds three datasets to the band:

. `<band_name>`*_dynamic_header* - the data from this dataset is copied to the right like a vertical band with table columns header.

. `<band_name>`*_master_data* - the data from this dataset is copied downwards like a horizontal band with table rows header.

. `<band_name>` - the dataset named the same as the band, it belongs to. It is the main content band that will fulfill the matrix cells.

These datasets can have any of available dataset types: xref:creation/bands.adoc#structure_sql[SQL], xref:creation/bands.adoc#structure_jpql[JPQL], xref:creation/bands.adoc#structure_groovy[Groovy], and so on.

For example, a crosstab report for the `BookInstance` entity of the *Library* sample application has the following structure:

image::crosstab-structure.png[align="center",width="1145"]

. Report data xref:creation/bands.adoc[structure]. There are three datasets:
+
* The `bi_dynamic_header` dataset will return the list of months names:
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
import java.text.DateFormatSymbols

List result = new ArrayList()
DateFormatSymbols dateFormatSymbols = DateFormatSymbols.getInstance(Locale.ENGLISH)
for (i in 0..dateFormatSymbols.months.length - 1) {
    result.add(["header_id" : i + 1, "month_name" : dateFormatSymbols.months[i]])
}
return result
----
+
* The `bi_master_data` dataset returns names and identifiers of the library departments selected by the user as an xref:creation/parameters.adoc[external report parameter]:
+
[source, sql,indent=0]
----
select name as name, id as department_id
from LIBRARY_DEPARTMENT
where id in (${selected_departments})
----
+
* The `bi` dataset will provide data for the matrix cells, which is the book amounts sum for the particular month and department. It takes `bi_master_data@department_id` (the department id) as the vertical coordinate of the cell, and `bi_dynamic_header@header_id` (the month name) as the horizontal coordinate, and fills the matrix cell with the `amount` value.
+
In the example below the report has two more external parameters: the `start_date` and the `end_date` that define the range of book instance creation dates. It would be a good idea to set up xref:creation/parameters.adoc#validation[cross-parameter validation] to make sure the range makes sense.
+
[source, sql,indent=0]
----
select bi.library_department_id as bi_master_data@department_id,
       month(bi.created_date) as bi_dynamic_header@header_id,
       sum(bi.book_count) as "amount"
from BOOK_INSTANCE bi
where bi.created_date >= ${start_date} and bi.created_date<= ${end_date}
and bi.library_department_id in (${bi_master_data@department_id})
and month(bi.created_date) in (${bi_dynamic_header@header_id})
group by bi.library_department_id,month(bi.created_date)
order by bi.library_department_id,month(bi.created_date)
----

. Report xref:creation/parameters.adoc[parameters].
+
The *Parameters* tab contains three declared report external parameters - `selected_departments`, `start_date`, `end_date`:
+
image::crosstab-external-params.png[align="center",width="819"]
+
When running the report, the user will have to enter these parameters. The department selection will be performed via the `LibraryDepartment.list` view, available in the application.

. Report xref:creation/templates.adoc[template].
+
Then you can create a XLS report template using Microsoft Office or LibreOffice.
+
The link:{attachmentsdir}/DepartmentBooks.xls[DepartmentBooks.xls] is an example of a template which outputs the list of `Departments` vertically and `Books` for each department horizontally grouped by the months the books were created.
+
This report template contains xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_xls_regions[named regions] for all three datasets of the crosstab band and, additionally, the named region for the column header: `<band_name>_header`. In our case it is `bi_header`.

You can run the report from the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* view.

[[example_jasper]]
== Sample JasperReports Report

The example is based on the sample *Library* application, please follow the xref:getting-started.adoc#project_setup_report[instruction] to set up your project then create entities and views.

In this example, we will create a JRXML report to display the list of book publications in the selected department:

image::sample_jasper_result.png[align="center"]

. On the xref:creation/details.adoc[Report details] tab, define the report name: `Books availability`.
. Switch to the xref:creation/bands.adoc[Bands] tab:
+
--
image::sample-jasper-bands.png[align="center",width="1056"]

Let's consider report bands.

* *Header* band - the report header. It contains the dataset with the Groovy script which outputs the report xref:creation/parameters.adoc[external parameters] value:
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
return [['library_department_name' : params['library_department'].name]]
----

* *Data* band outputs the list of book instances in the department passed as a parameter by running the following Groovy script:
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/resources/com/company/library/reports/bands/sample-jasper.groovy[]
----

This query uses the external report parameter - `library_department`. The parameter has the *Entity* type, however you can compare it directly with entity identifier fields; the conversion will be done automatically.
--

. Report xref:creation/parameters.adoc[parameters].
+
The *Parameters* tab contains one declared report external parameter - `Department`:
+
image::sample-jasper-parameter.png[align="center",width="642"]
+
When running the report, the user will have to enter this parameter. The department selection will be performed via the `LibraryDepartment.list` view, available in the application.

. Report xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_jasper[template].
+
--
Create the new JRXML file or download link:{attachmentsdir}/BookAvailability.jrxml[BookAvailability.jrxml] with the following content:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/resources/com/company/library/reports/templates/BookAvailability.jrxml[]
----

The table in this template is bound to a subDataset. The `title` element uses the *Header* band data directly. You can open the template file in JasperReports visual designer to see the report layout.

Upload the new template to the application, selecting any output type, and make it default:

== HTML Report with Groovy Template Engine

The example is based on the sample *Library* application, please follow the xref:getting-started.adoc#project_setup_report[instruction] to set up your project then create entities and views.

Let’s create a report that displays the list of book publications for the selected city. The output format is HTML:

image::html-groovy-result.png[align="center",width="735"]

. Create a report with JPQL dataset:
+
image::html-groovy-bands.png[align="center",width="917"]
+
The `BookPublications` band outputs the list of book's publications by running the following JPQL query:
+
[source, sql,indent=0]
----
select b.name as "book",
p.name as "publisher"
from BookPublication bp
left join bp.book b
left join bp.publisher p
where bp.city = ${city}
----
+
This query uses the external report parameter - `city`. The parameter has the *Entity* type.

. Describe the report xref:creation/parameters.adoc[parameter]:
+
The *Parameters* tab contains one declared report external parameter - `City`:
+
image::html-groovy-parameter.png[align="center",width="642"]
+
When running the report, the user will have to enter this parameter. The city selection will be performed via the `City.list` view, available in the application.

. Create a report xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_html[template]
+
Create the new HTML file or download link:{attachmentsdir}/PublicationByCity.html[PublicationByCity.html] with the following content:
+
[source, html,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/resources/com/company/library/reports/templates/PublicationByCity.html[tags=**]
----
+
The value of the input parameter is used to generate the report title: `${Root.fields.city.name}`.
+
The variable `bookPublications` is defined below:
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/resources/com/company/library/reports/templates/PublicationByCity.html[tags=bookPublications]
----
+
This variable is used in the table's body to display the report fields.
+
[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/resources/com/company/library/reports/templates/PublicationByCity.html[tags=report-fields]
----
+
Upload the new template to the application, select HTML output type, select *Groovy template* in the *Template type* radiobutton and make it default:
+
image::html-groovy-template.png[align="center",width="642"]

You can run the report from the *Reports* -> *Run Reports* view.
