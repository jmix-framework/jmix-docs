= Running Reports

[[run_common]]
== Running from Reports List View

The easiest way to run reports is from the report run view, which is available in the *Reports* -> *Run report* view. The user must have the right to access this view. The list will contain all reports that are xref:creation/permissions.adoc[available to the user] in accordance with their role. If the report has external parameters, they will be requested in a special form when running the report.

[[run_actions]]
== Running from Views

You can run reports from arbitrary views using special actions and associated buttons or component context menu items. In this case, the xref:creation/permissions.adoc[availability] of the report directly in this view is checked in addition to a user role.

Action types and examples of their use are provided below.

[[run_report_action]]
* `io.jmix.reportsflowui.action.RunReportAction` - a xref:flow-ui:actions/standard-actions.adoc[standard action] for running the reports associated with the current view or list component. It should be defined for a `Button` or a list component (`DataGrid`, `TreeDataGrid`).
+
Below is an example of using the declarative action for the `DataGrid`:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/resources/com/company/library/view/book/book-list-view.xml[tags=buttonsPanel;reportRun;booksDataGrid;actions;report_runReport]
----
<1> Add a button with run report action.
<2> The `type` attribute defines a specific `report_runReport` action type, provided by the framework.
+
Example of programmatically creating the action together with a button declared in the view XML descriptor:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/java/com/company/library/view/book/BookListView.java[tags=runBtn;actions;onInit;create]
----
+
When the action is performed, a modal **Report Run** dialog will open where reports related to the current view will be displayed. When a user selects a report from the list, the parameters input form is displayed (if any were defined) and the report is run.

[[run-list-entity-report-action]]
* `io.jmix.reportsflowui.action.RunListEntityReportAction` - a xref:ui:actions/standard-actions.adoc[standard action] for printing reports for entity instances associated with a list component (`DataGrid`, `TreeDataGrid`).
+
The action only selects reports having an external parameter of the *Entity* or the *List of entities* type and where the parameter entity type matches the entity type displayed by the list component. If only one report is available as a result of selection, it is invoked immediately. If several reports are available, their list is offered to the user for selection.
+
The external parameter value is passed to the report using the following rules:

** If the parameter has the *List of entities* type, the list of instances currently selected in the list component is passed into it.

** If the parameter has the *Entity* type, and the list component has a single instance selected (one row is highlighted), then this instance is passed into the report.

** If the parameter is of the *Entity* type, and the list component has several rows selected, then the report runs several times according to the number of selected instances. After execution, the user gets a single ZIP archive containing all generated reports.
+
Below is an example of using the declarative action for the `DataGrid`:
+
[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/resources/com/company/library/view/author/author-list-view.xml[tags=buttonsPanel;runList;authorsDataGrid;actions]
----
<1> Add a button with run list entity report action.
<2> The `type` attribute defines a specific `report_runListEntityReport` action type, provided by the framework.
+
Example of programmatically creating the action together with a button declared in the view XML descriptor:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/java/com/company/library/view/author/AuthorListView.java[tags=runBtn;actions;onInit;runList]
----
+
When the action is performed, if no entities were selected from the list component, a confirmation window will be displayed.
+
image::run-list-entity-report-action-confirmation.png[align="center",width="402"]
+
After that, the modal **Report Run** dialog will open where reports related to the current view will be displayed. From this modal view, the user can run some report for the selected entity.

[[run-single-entity-report-action]]
* `io.jmix.reportsflowui.action.RunSingleEntityReportAction` - an action associated with an entity detail view. The action only selects reports having an external parameter of the *Entity* or the *List of entities* type and where the parameter entity type matches the edited entity type. If only one report is available as a result of selection, it is invoked immediately. If several reports are available, their list is offered to user for selection.
+
The external parameter value - edited entity instance - is passed into the report. If the parameter has the *List of entities* type, then a list containing a single item is passed.
+
Below is an example of using the action in a button located near the standard *OK* and *Cancel* buttons:

[[report-runner]]
=== ReportRunner

`ReportRunner` is an interface used for running reports. All its methods return the `ReportOutputDocument` object that contains the result of report execution.

Below are a few examples using `ReportRunner`.

. Running a report based on the information specified in the <<report-run-context,ReportRunContext>> object:

[[ui-report-runner]]
=== UIReportRunner

`UiReportRunner` is an interface for executing reports from the application views. In addition to the options required to run a report, `UiReportRunner` allows you to configure the following features:

* Displaying the result of the report execution in the browser (in the case of table templates).
+
[source, java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/library/src/main/java/com/company/library/view/runreport/RunReportView.java[tags=run-and-show]
----

* Whether to show a dialog to input the report parameters before run. Use `ParametersDialogShowMode` for this purpose. Three modes are supported:

** `YES` - to show the dialog to input the report parameters.
** `NO` - do not show the dialog to input the report parameters.
** `IF_REQUIRED` - to show the dialog to input the report parameters if:
+
*** The report has input parameters;
*** The report has several templates;
*** The report has one template with an alterable output type.

* Execute report generation synchronously or in the background:
+

The `runMultipleReports()` method runs a report for each object from the specified collection. Objects in the collection should have the same type as an input parameter with specified alias.

[[report-run-context]]
=== ReportRunContext

The `ReportRunContext` class stores the following information required for report running:

* The `Report` entity;
* The `ReportTemplate` entity: if not specified, the default template is used;
* Input parameters;
* Type of output document;
* Output name pattern.

Let's look at examples of creating a `ReportRunContext`:

// TODO cancel report #22
// [[run_cancel]]
// == Cancelling Reports Execution

// If the report execution is running as a background task, it can be interrupted by the user.

// To add the cancel option, set the xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.reports.client.useBackgroundReportProcessing[jmix.reports.client.useBackgroundReportProcessing] property to `true`:

// [source, groovy,indent=0]
// ----
// jmix.reports.client.useBackgroundReportProcessing = true
// ----

// Thus, the window with the progress bar and the *Cancel* button will be displayed:

// .Cancel report
// image::run_cancel.png[align="center"]

// You can also set the processing timeout using the xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.reports.client.backgroundReportProcessingTimeoutMs[jmix.reports.client.backgroundReportProcessingTimeoutMs] property:

// [source, groovy,indent=0]
// ----
// jmix.reports.client.backgroundReportProcessingTimeoutMs = 30000
// ----

// When the time is up, the task will be canceled regardless the result, and the user will receive an error message:

// .Report error
// image::run_timeout.png[align="center"]

// To cancel the report execution programmatically, use the `cancelReportExecution()` method of the `ReportService` interface that takes the identifiers of the user session and the report:

// [source, java,indent=0]
// ----
// reportService.cancelReportExecution(userSessionId, report.getId());
