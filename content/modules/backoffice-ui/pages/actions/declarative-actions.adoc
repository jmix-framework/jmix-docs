= Declarative Actions

You can specify a set of actions in an XML screen descriptor for any component that implements the `ActionsHolder` interface, including the entire window or fragment. You can do it in the `actions` element, which contains nested `action` elements.

== Action Attributes

The `action` element can have the following attributes:

* `id` - identifier, which should be unique within the `ActionsHolder` component.
* `type` - defines a specific action type. If this attribute is set, the framework finds the class having the `@ActionType` annotation with the specified value, and uses it to instantiate the action. If the type is not defined, the framework creates an instance of the xref:actions/base-action.adoc[BaseAction] class. See xref:actions/standard-actions.adoc[Standard Actions] for how to use action types provided by the framework and xref:actions/custom-action-type.adoc[Custom Action Types] for how to create your own types.
* `caption` - action name.
* `description` - action description.
* `enable` - accessibility flag. Possible values: `true`, `false`.
* `icon` - action icon.
* `primary` - attribute that indicates if a button representing this action should be highlighted with a special visual style. Possible values: `true`, `false`.
+
The highlighting is available by default in the `hover` and `helium` themes; to enable this feature in the `halo` theme, set `true` for the `$jmix-highlight-primary-action` xref:themes/custom_theme.adoc#theme-modify-common-parameters[style variable].
+
The `create` standard list action and the `lookupSelectAction` in the lookup screen are primary by default.

* `shortcut` - a keyboard shortcut.
+
Shortcut values can be hard-coded in the XML descriptor. Possible modifiers, ALT, CTRL, SHIFT, are separated by the "-" character. For example:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/actions/action-screen.xml[tags=action-shortcut]
----
+
To avoid the hard-coded values, you can use the predefined shortcut aliases from the list below, for example:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/actions/action-screen.xml[tags=action-predefined-shortcut]
----
+
The following predefined shortcut aliases are supported:
+
** `TABLE_EDIT_SHORTCUT`
** `TABLE_INSERT_SHORTCUT`
** `TABLE_ADD_SHORTCUT`
** `TABLE_REMOVE_SHORTCUT`
** `COMMIT_SHORTCUT`
** `CLOSE_SHORTCUT`
** `NEXT_TAB_SHORTCUT`
** `PREVIOUS_TAB_SHORTCUT`
** `PICKER_LOOKUP_SHORTCUT`
** `PICKER_OPEN_SHORTCUT`
** `PICKER_CLEAR_SHORTCUT`
+
Another option is to use the fully qualified name of the `UiComponentProperties` class and method which returns shortcut:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/actions/action-screen.xml[tags=action-shortcut-fully-name]
----
* `visible` - visibility flag. Possible values: `true`, `false`.

== Examples

The examples of action declaration and handling are provided below.

=== Screen Actions

In the example below, we declare an action with the `sayHello` identifier and a caption from the screen’s message pack. This action is bound to a button, which caption will be taken from the action’s caption.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/actions/action-screen.xml[tags=window-start;window-actions-start;actions-whole-screen;window-actions-end;layout-start;button-sayHello;layout-end;window-end]
----

The screen controller subscribes to the action’s `ActionPerformedEvent`, so the `onSayHello()` method will be invoked when the user clicks the button or presses the *ALT-T* keyboard shortcut.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=notifications;say-hello]
----
<1> The `@Subscribe` annotation contains the action id.

[NOTE]
====
Note that actions declared for the whole screen do not refresh their state. It means that if an action has a specific `enabledRule`, it will not be applied until `refreshState()` is invoked manually.
====

[TIP]
====
You can generate the `Action.ActionPerformedEvent` handler implementation stub using xref:studio:index.adoc[Studio].
====

=== PopupButton Actions

In the example below, we declare a `popupButton` with actions in the XML-descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/actions/action-screen.xml[tags=popup-button-actions]
----

Subscribe to the action’s `ActionPerformedEvent` in the screen controller:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=notifications;say-hello-goodbye]
----
<1> The `@Subscribe` annotation contains the `PopupButton` `id` and the `id` of the action separated by a dot.

=== Table Actions

In the example below, we declare a `groupTable` with actions in the XML-descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/actions/action-screen.xml[tags=group-table-actions]
----

In this example, the `copy` action is declared in addition to `create`, `edit` and `remove` standard actions of the table. The `trackSelection="true"` attribute means that the action and corresponding button become disabled if no row is selected in the table. It is useful if the action is intended to be executed for a currently selected table row.

Subscribe to the action’s `ActionPerformedEvent` in the screen controller:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=copy-action]
----

=== EntityPicker Actions

In the example below, we declare the standard `entity_lookup` action and an additional `points` action for the xref:vcl/components/entity-picker.adoc[EntityPicker] component. The `description` attribute allows you to display a tooltip when hovering over the action button.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/entitypicker/entityPicker-screen.xml[tags=customAction]
----

Then implement custom logic in the screen controller by subscribing to `Action.ActionPerformedEvent`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/entitypicker/EntityPickerScreen.java[tags=customerEntityPicker;customAction]
----

<1> The `@Subscribe` annotation contains the `EntityPicker` `id` and the `id` of the action separated by a dot.

== Obtaining Reference to Action

You can obtain a reference to any declared action in the screen controller either directly by injection or from a component that implements the `ActionsHolder` interface. It can be useful to set action properties programmatically. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=say-btn-hello;say-btn;before-show]
----
