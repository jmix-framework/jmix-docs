= SuggestionField

`SuggestionField` allows searching for certain values according to a string entered by a user.

It can use any types of options: entities, strings, or enum values, and does not have action buttons. The list of options is loaded in the background according to the logic defined by the application developer on the server-side.

Component’s XML-name: `suggestionField`.

== Basics

Use `SuggestionField` if:

* Users need to select a single option.
* The number of options in the list of suggested values is too large to use xref:vcl/components/combo-box.adoc[ComboBox] or xref:vcl/components/entity-combo-box.adoc[EntityComboBox].
* You want to provide high-performance search in the database without loading much data to the UI layer.

`SuggestionField` is an input text field with the additional functionality: a user enters a few characters, and if several matches have been found, all of them will be displayed in a drop-down list. `SuggestionField` refreshes the list of options on each entered symbol.

[[search-executor]]
== SearchExecutor

`SearchExecutor` is a functional interface that contains a single method: `List<E> search(String searchString, Map<String, Object> searchParams)`.

Use the `searchString` parameter to filter candidates using the string entered by the user.

In the most common case, it is sufficient to set a `SearchExecutor` implementation to the component.

`SearchExecutor` can return any types of options, for example, entities, strings, or enum values.

[[search-executor-entities]]
* Entities
+
First, declare a component in the XML descriptor:
+
[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/suggestionfield-screen.xml[tags=entity-search-executor]
----
+
Then set `SearchExecutor` to the component:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/SuggestionFieldScreen.java[tags=entity-search-executor]
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can generate the `SearchExecutor` implementation stub using Studio.
====

[[search-executor-strings]]
* Strings
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/SuggestionFieldScreen.java[tags=string-search-executor]
----

[[enum-executor-strings]]
* Enum
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/SuggestionFieldScreen.java[tags=enum-search-executor]
----

[WARNING]
====
The `search()` method is executed in a background thread, so it cannot access visual components or data containers used by visual components. Call xref:data-access:data-manager.adoc[DataManager] or a service directly, or process and return data loaded to the screen beforehand.
====

=== escapeForLike
You can use the `escapeForLike()` method to search for the values that contain special symbols:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/SuggestionFieldScreen.java[tags=escape-for-like]
----

[[suggestions-managing]]
== Suggestions Managing

[[async-search-delay-ms]]
=== asyncSearchDelayMs

The `asyncSearchDelayMs` attribute sets the delay between the last key press action and asynchronous search.

[[min-search-string-length]]
=== minSearchStringLength

The `minSearchStringLength` attribute sets the minimal string length, which is required to perform suggestions search.

If you set `minSearchStringLength = 1` the suggestion popup is displayed almost immediately after the user starts typing, and too many suggestions appear at first. If you search through a large amount of data, make `SuggestionField` less sensitive, for example:

[source,code,indent=0]
----
minSearchStringLength="4"
----

[[popup-width]]
=== popupWidth

The `popupWidth` attribute sets the width of the suggestion popup.

Possible options:

* `auto` - the popup width will be equal to the maximum width of suggestions.
* `parent` - the popup width will be equal to the width of the main component.
* absolute (e.g. `"170px"`) or relative (e.g. `"50%"`) value.

[[suggestions-limit]]
=== suggestionsLimit

The `suggestionsLimit` attribute sets the limit of suggestions to be displayed. The default value is `10`.

[[options-style-provider]]
== Using OptionsStyleProvider

`OptionsStyleProvider` allows managing additional style names for the suggested options displayed by `SuggestionField`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/SuggestionFieldScreen.java[tags=option-style-provider]
----

Then you should define the item styles set in the application theme. Detailed information on creating a theme is available in xref:themes.adoc[Themes]. Style names representing in the controller, together with prefixes identifying each item, form CSS selectors. For example:

[source, scss,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/themes/helium-extended/helium-extended-defaults.scss[tags=suggestion-field-styles]
----
