= EntitySuggestionField


////
`SuggestionField` allows searching for certain values according to a string entered by a user.

It can use any types of options: entities, strings, or enum values, and does not have action buttons. The list of options is loaded in the background according to the logic defined by the application developer on the server-side.

Component’s XML-name: `suggestionField`.

== Basics

Use `SuggestionField` if:

* Users need to select a single option.
* The number of options in the list of suggested values is too large to use xref:vcl/components/combo-box.adoc[ComboBox] xref:vcl/components/entity-combo-box.adoc[EntityComboBox].
* High performance is essential with a large amount of data being uploaded.
* Users need searching functionality.

`SuggestionField` is an input text field with the additional functionality: a user enters a few characters, and if several matches have been found, all of them will be displayed in a drop-down list. `SuggestionField` refreshes the list of options on each entered symbol.

To create `SuggestionField` connected to data, use the xref:vcl/xml.adoc#data-container[dataContainer] and xref:vcl/xml.adoc#property[property] attributes:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/suggestionfield-screen.xml[tags=data;suggestion-field]
----

<1> `InstanceContainer` for the `Address` entity.
<2> Inline fetch plan of the entity instance located in the container.

In the example above, the screen defines the `addressDc` data container for the `Address` entity having the `country` attribute. In the `suggestionField` element, the `dataContainer` attribute contains a link to the `addressDc` data container, and the `property` attribute refers to the `country` entity attribute. The entity attribute should be a reference to an entity. In the following example, it is `Country`.

[[options]]
== Defining Options
//Creating a list of options
//specify
//set
//Defining list of options
You can specify a list of options either in the XML descriptor using the `query` nested element or programmatically in the controller using the `SearchExecutor` interface.

[[query]]
=== query

`query` is an optional element that enables defining a query for selecting suggested values.

[WARNING]
====
You can specify only the list of entity instances using the `query` element.
====

The `query` element has the following attributes:

[[entityClass]]
* `entityClass` (required) - a full qualified name of an entity class.

[[fetch-plan]]
* `fetchPlan` - an optional attribute that specifies the fetch plan to be used for loading the queried entity.

[[escape-value-for-like]]
* `escapeValueForLike` - enables searching for the values that contain special symbols: `%`, `\`, etc. Default value is `false`.

[[search-string-format]]
* `searchStringFormat` - a Groovy string; thus, you can use any valid Groovy-string expressions.

[[search-executor]]
=== SearchExecutor

If `query` is not defined, you should programmatically set the list of options using `SearchExecutor`.

In the most common case, it is sufficient to set `SearchExecutor` to the component. `SearchExecutor` is a functional interface that contains a single method: `List<E> search(String searchString, Map<String, Object> searchParams)`.

`SearchExecutor` can return any types of options, for example, entities, strings, or enum values.

[[search-executor-entities]]
* Entities
+
First, declare a component in the XML descriptor:
+
[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/suggestionfield-screen.xml[tags=entity-search-executor]
----
+
Then set `SearchExecutor` to the component:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/SuggestionFieldScreen.java[tags=entity-search-executor]
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can generate the `SearchExecutor` implementation method’s stub using the Studio.

[[search-executor-strings]]
* Strings
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/SuggestionFieldScreen.java[tags=string-search-executor]
----

[[enum-executor-strings]]
* Enum
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/SuggestionFieldScreen.java[tags=enum-search-executor]
----

[WARNING]
====
The `search()` method is executed in a background thread, so it cannot access visual components or data containers used by visual components. Call xref:data-access:data-manager.adoc[DataManager] or a middleware service directly, or process and return data loaded to the screen beforehand.
====

The `searchString` parameter can be used to filter candidates using the string entered by the user. You can use the `escapeForLike()` method to search for the values that contain special symbols:

[[suggestions-managing]]
== Suggestions Managing

[[async-search-delay-ms]]
=== asyncSearchDelayMs

The `asyncSearchDelayMs` attribute sets the delay between the last key press action and asynchronous search.

[[min-search-string-length]]
=== minSearchStringLength

The `minSearchStringLength` attribute sets the minimal string length, which is required to perform suggestions search.

If you set `minSearchStringLength = 1` the suggestion popup is displayed almost immediately after the user starts typing, and too many suggestions appear at first. If a large amount of data is being uploaded, it's recommended to make `SuggestionField` less sensitive, e.g.:

[source,code,indent=0]
----
minSearchStringLength="4"
----

[[popup-width]]
=== popupWidth

The `popupWidth` attribute sets the width of the suggestion popup.

Possible options:

* `auto` - the popup width will be equal to the maximum width of suggestions.
* `parent` - the popup width will be equal to the width of the main component.
* absolute (e.g. `"170px"`) or relative (e.g. `"50%"`) value.

[[suggestions-limit]]
=== suggestionsLimit

The `suggestionsLimit` attribute sets the limit of suggestions to be displayed. The default value is `10`.

[[options-style-provider]]
== Using OptionsStyleProvider

`OptionsStyleProvider` allows managing additional style names for the suggested options displayed by `SuggestionField`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/suggestionfield/SuggestionFieldScreen.java[tags=option-style-provider]
----

Then you should define the item styles set in the application theme. Detailed information on creating a theme is available in xref:themes.adoc[Themes]. Style names representing in the controller, together with prefixes identifying each item, form CSS selectors. For example:

[source, scss,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/themes/helium-extended/helium-extended-defaults.scss[tags=suggestion-field-styles]
----
