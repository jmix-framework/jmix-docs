= GridLayout

`GridLayout` is a container that allows you to place components in a grid.

Component's XML-name: `gridLayout`.

Usage example:

[[required-elements]]
== Required Elements

[[columns]]
=== Columns

[[count]]
`columns` – describes grid columns. It should have either a `count` attribute or a nested `column` element for each `column`. It is enough to set the number of columns in the `count` attribute in the simplest case.

If you define the container width in pixels or percents, free space will be divided between the columns equally.

[[flex-col]]
If you define the `flex` attribute for each `column` element, free space will be divided between the columns non-equally.

An example of a `GridLayout` where the second and the fourth columns take all extra horizontal space, and the fourth column takes three times more space:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/gridlayout/grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=flex-grid-layout]
----

image::vcl/containers/grid-layout-flex.png[align="center"]

If the `flex` attribute is not defined or equals `0`, the width of the column will be set according to its contents, given that at least one other column has a non-zero `flex` attribute. In the example above, the first and the third columns will get the width according to the maximum text length.

[NOTE]
====

For the free space to appear, you should set the entire container width in either pixels or percents. Otherwise, column width will be calculated according to content length, and the `flex` attribute will not affect it.

Attributes of `column`:

* xref:vcl/xml.adoc#box-expand-ratio[box.expandRatio]
* xref:vcl/xml.adoc#colspan[colspan]
* <<flex-col, flex>>
* xref:vcl/xml.adoc#id[id]
* xref:vcl/xml.adoc#rowspan[rowspan]

[[rows]]
=== Rows

[[flex-row]]
`rows` − contains a set of rows. Each line is defined in its own `row` element. `row` element can have a `flex` attribute similar to the one defined for the `column` element but affects free vertical space distribution with a given total grid height.

`row` element should contain elements of the components displayed in the grid’s current row cells. The number of components in a row should not exceed the defined number of columns, but it can be less.

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/gridlayout/grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=row-flex-grid-layout]
----

Any component located in a `GridLayout` can have `xref:vcl/xml.adoc#colspan[colspan]` and `xref:vcl/xml.adoc#rowspan[rowspan]` attributes. These attributes set the number of columns and rows occupied by the corresponding component. For example, this is how the `Field3` `textField` can be extended to cover three columns:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/gridlayout/grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=span-grid-layout]

* xref:vcl/xml.adoc#colspan[colspan]
* <<flex-row, flex>>
