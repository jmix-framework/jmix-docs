Component's XML-name: `drawer`.

[[basics]]
== Basics

The definition of the drawer in the screen descriptor should have the following structure:

1. xref:vcl/containers/css-layout.adoc[CssLayout] that contains both `drawer` and the rest screen layout, with `jmix-drawer-layout` style assigned.
2. The `drawer` itself should include the following containers, those represent:
a. `Drawer` header, with `jmix-drawer-header` style assigned.
//todo add link to SideMenu
b. `Drawer` content, for example, `SideMenu`, with `jmix-drawer-content` style assigned.
c. `Drawer` footer, with `jmix-drawer-footer` style assigned.
3. A xref:vcl/components/button.adoc[button] placed within a `drawer` footer and used to toggle `Drawer` collapsed state.

[[toggle]]
== Toggle

The `toggle()` method expands or collapses the `drawer` depending on its current state. For example, if the `drawer` is already collapsed, it will be expanded after calling the `toggle()` method, and vice versa.

[[is-collapsed]]
You can also check the drawer's current state using the `isCollapsed()` method.

== Attributes

[[expand-on-hover]]
* `expandOnHover` attribute sets a mode when the `drawer` is expanded on hover. Note that the collapse state is not changed. The default value is `false`.

[[usage-example]]
== Usage Example

The most common way to use the `drawer` is on the app’s main screen.

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/drawer/drawer-screen.xml[tags=drawer]
----

Programmatically we define that the `toggle()` method will be called for `drawer` after clicking on the `collapseDrawerButton`. And for the `button`, we will change the icon depending on the state of the `drawer`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/containers/drawer/DrawerScreen.java[tags=drawer]
----
