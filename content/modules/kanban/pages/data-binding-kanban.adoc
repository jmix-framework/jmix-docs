= 1. Binding Kanban to Data

In this chapter, you will create:

* The `TaskStatus` enumeration.
* The `KanbanTask` entity with the attributes required to be displayed on the Kanban board.
* CRUD views with a Kanban board on the `KanbanTask.list` view.

[[entity-and-view-creation]]
== Creating KanbanTask Entity and Views

To start, you'll need to generate a `TaskStatus` enumeration consisting of the following values:

* `Todo`
* `In progress`
* `Verification`
* `Done`

The detailed instructions for creating enumerations can be found in the xref:tutorial:enumerations.adoc[Using Enumerations] section of the Tutorial.

image::enumeration-task-status-type.png[align="center", width="406"]

Next, create the `KanbanTask` entity. You can find detailed instructions for creating entities in the xref:tutorial:simple-crud.adoc[Simple CRUD] section of the Tutorial.

The `KanbanTask` entity has the following attributes:

* `text` with `String` type. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `status` with `TaskStatus` enumeration type. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `assignee` with association to `User`, many-to-one cardinality.

image::assignee-attribute.png[align="center", width="862"]

Define the `text` attribute for generation an xref:studio:entity-designer.adoc#creating-instance-name[instance name].

Create _detail view_ for the `KanbanTask` entity. You'll find the detailed steps for generating entity list and detail views in the xref:tutorial:simple-crud.adoc#create-views[Creating CRUD Views] section of the Tutorial.

Follow the suggested values at each step of the view creation wizard.

NOTE: On the *Entity detail view fetch plan* step, add the `assignee` attribute to the selection. Now you can be sure that the referenced `User` entity will be loaded together with the root `KanbanTask` entity and displayed in the detail view.

Studio will automatically generate `KanbanTask.detail`, and open the corresponding source code.

[[adding-kanban]]
== Adding Kanban on View

You'll need to create a blank view with `KanbanTask.list` id. This view will be used to add a Kanban board.

image::kanban-task-list-view-wizard.png[align="center", width="776"]

At the final step of the wizard, set the localizable message of the view title: `Kanban board`.

Locate `kanban-task-list-view.xml` in the *Jmix* tool window and double-click it. The view designer will appear.
To start, you'll add a `collectionContainer` to load tasks from the database. The detailed instructions for defining Data Container can be found in the xref:tutorial:ui-from-scratch.adoc#define-data-container[Creating UI from Scratch] of the Tutorial.

Click *Add Component* in the actions panel, then find the `CollectionContainer` item and double-click it:

image::create-kanban-task-collection-container.png[align="center", width="647"]

In the dialog that opens, select the `KanbanTask` entity. The new `collectonContainer` element will be added to both the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel and the XML.

To ensure the `dataLoader` automatically loads data when the view opens, you need to add the xref:flow-ui:facets/dataLoadCoordinator.adoc[dataLoadCoordinator] facet. Click *Add Component* in the action panel, then find the `DataLoadCoordinator` item and double-click it:

image::create-data-load-coordinator.png[align="center", width="511"]

If you want to display a Kanban on the view, you should include the xref:kanban-component.adoc[kanban] UI component in the XML descriptor.

Place the cursor inside the `layout` element.

Next, click *Add Component* in the actions panel, then find the `Kanban` item and double-click it:

image::create-kanban-component.png[align="center", width="743"]

Configure the `id`, `dataContainer`, `height` and `width` attributes as shown below.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<kanban:kanban id="kanban" dataContainer="kanbanTasksDc" width="100%" height="100%"/>
----

[[configuring-columns]]
=== Configuring Columns

To display the `Kanban` board component on the view, you need to define xref:kanban-component.adoc#column[columns]. To do this, select `kanban` in the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel or in the XML descriptor, then click the *Add* button in the component inspector panel. From the drop-down list, choose *Columns -> Column*.

image::create-kanban-column.png[align="center", width="398"]

In the dialog that opens, you'll define the mandatory column attribute `dataField`. This attribute is the identifier of the column in the `kanban` component. You need to define the column so that the values of the `dataField` attribute match the values of the `TaskStatus` enumeration. Additionally, you need to define the `label` attribute. The value of this attribute will be displayed in the column header.

image::configure-kanban-columns.png[align="center", width="1314"]

Now, you can run the application to see the new component in action.

Click the *Debug* button (image:start-debugger.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Before launching the application, Studio compares the project data model with the database schema. When you created a new entity, Studio automatically generates a Liquibase changelog to reflect the relevant database modifications (such as creating the `KANBAN_TASK` table):

image::changelog-kanban-task.png[align="center", width="1036"]

Click *Save and run*.

Studio will execute the changelog on your database, followed by building and running the application:

image::run-app.png[align="center", width="1290"]

Once the application is up and running, navigate to `++http://localhost:8080++` using your web browser and sign in to the application with the credentials admin/admin.

Choose the *Kanban board* item from the *Application* menu. You will see the `KanbanTask.list` view:

image::kanban-task-list.png[align="center', width="1143"]

[[adding-actions]]
=== Adding Actions

To provide the ability to create, edit and remove tasks, you need to add xref:kanban-component.adoc#actions[actions] to the component.

Choose `kanban` within the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel or in the view XML descriptor, and then click the *Add* button in the component inspector panel. From the drop-down list, choose *Actions -> Action*.

image::create-kanban-actions.png[align="center", width="477"]

Specify the actions you want to add. For example: `list_create`, `list_edit`, `list_remove`.

image::create-kanban-actions2.png[align="center", width="563"]

Click the *OK* button. The `action` elements will be added in both the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel and in the XML. Next, to use these actions, you need to create buttons panel.

Place the cursor before the `kanban` element. Next, click *Add Component* in the actions panel, then find the `hbox` item and double-click it. To add the required styles, add the `classNames` attribute with the value `buttons-panel` to the `hbox`:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
<hbox classNames="buttons-panel"/>
----

Select `hbox` within the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel or in the view XML descriptor, and then click the *Add Component* button in the actions  panel, then find the `button` item and double-click it.

Use the component inspector panel to assign an action to the `button`. Create and assign buttons for each action.

image::create-kanban-buttons.png[align="center", width="613"]

To make task editing more convenient, you'll need to open the detail view in dialog mode. To do this, select the `create` action in the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel or in the XML descriptor, then change the open mode property to `DIALOG`. Repeat the same steps for the `edit` action.

image::create-kanban-actions3.png[align="center", width="477"]

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application.

Choose the *Kanban board* item from the *Application* menu. You can now create, edit and remove tasks using the detail view dialog:

image::task-entity-crud.png[align="center",width="1143"]

== Auto Data Saving
[[auto-data-saving]]

The `kanban` component keeps temporary changes in a data container until a confirmation action is triggered to commit them to the database. This behavior is typical for visual components.

To enable automatic saving of the xref:flow-ui:data/data-context.adoc[DataContext], you can use the xref:kanban-component.adoc#autoSave[autoSave] attribute.

Choose `kanban:kanban` in the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel or in the view XML descriptor, and then check the *autoSave* box in the inspector panel.

[NOTE]
====
Don't forget to remove the `readOnly="true"` attribute from the `loader`. Otherwise, the changes will not be saved to the database.
====

image::auto-data-saving.png[align="center",width="1097"]

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application.

Move any `kanbanTask` to a different column on the Kanban board and make sure the task's new status persists even after you reopen the board.

[[editing-double-click]]
== Editing by Double-Clicking

Kanban supports event handling. For more information on available events, please refer to the xref:kanban-component.adoc#handlers[handlers] section.

To enable editing a Kanban task card by double-clicking, you need to implement a xref:kanban-component.adoc#KanbanTaskDoubleClickEvent[KanbanTaskDoubleClickEvent] handler.

Open the `KanbanTaskListView.java` class. To generate the handler method from scratch, click *Generate Handler* in the actions panel at the top of the code editor:

image::generate-handlers.png[align="center",width="727"]

Then select `KanbanTaskDoubleClickEvent` in the `Kanban` handlers section of the tree:

image::generate-task-double-click-handler.png[align="center",width="987"]

Now you need to implement the logic for opening the detail view:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/kanban-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/kanbantasklist/KanbanTaskListView.java[tags=dialogWindows;kanban;doubleClickHandler]
----

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application. You can now edit the card by double-clicking.
