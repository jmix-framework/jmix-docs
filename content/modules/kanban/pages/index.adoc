The Kanban add-on provides a `kanban` board component that visually represents the workflow of a project. It uses cards to represent tasks and columns to represent different stages of the project, allowing users to see the progress at a glance. The add-on is based on the https://htmlelements.com/demos/kanban/overview/[Smart Kanban^] JavaScript library.
