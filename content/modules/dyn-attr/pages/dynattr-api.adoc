= Dynamic Attributes API

[[model]]
== Model

Dynamic attributes implement the Entity-Attribute-Value model.

* `Category` specifies a category of objects and the corresponding set of dynamic attributes. Each category needs to be linked to a specific entity type.
+
For instance, consider an entity classified as `Car`. In this scenario, we can create two categories: `Truck` and `Passenger`. The `Truck` category may encompass attributes like `Load capacity` and `Body type`, while the `Passenger` could include attributes such as `Number of seats` and `Child seat`.
+
* `CategoryAttribute` represents a dynamic attribute associated with a specific category. Each attribute defines a single field with a specific data type. The required `code` field holds the system identifier of the attribute, while the `name` field contains the human-readable attribute name.

* `CategoryAttributeValue` signifies the value of a dynamic attribute for a specific entity instance. These values are stored in the dedicated `SYS_ATTR_VALUE` table. Each record in the table is linked to a particular entity through the `ENTITY_ID` column.

An entity instance can possess dynamic attributes from all categories linked to its entity type. For instance, if you establish two categories for the `Car` entity as described earlier, you can assign any dynamic attribute from both categories to a `Car` instance.

If you want to categorize an entity instance under a single category - for instance, a car being classified as either a truck or passenger - the entity must implement the `Categorized` interface. This setup ensures that an entity instance is affiliated with a specific category and possesses dynamic attributes exclusively from that category.

== Loading and Saving

Loading and saving dynamic attribute values is handled by `DataManager`. Use one of these methods to indicate that dynamic attributes should be loaded for entity instances:

* `setHint(DynAttrQueryHints.LOAD_DYN_ATTR, true)` method of `LoadContext`.
* `hint(DynAttrQueryHints.LOAD_DYN_ATTR, true)` method of the fluent API.

By default, dynamic attributes are not loaded. At the same time, `DataManager` always saves dynamic attributes contained in entity instances passed to `save()`.

Dynamic attribute values are available through `getValue()` / `setValue()` methods of `EntityValues`. Pass the attribute code with the `+` prefix to these methods, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/dyn-attr-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/car/CarListView.java[tags=get-value]
----

In practice, direct access to attribute values in the application code is rarely necessary. Any dynamic attribute can be automatically displayed in any `DataGrid` or `FormLayout` component linked to a data container featuring the entity associated with the dynamic attribute. When setting up dynamic attributes, you can define xref:dyn-attr:dynattr-managing.adoc#visibility[attribute visibility] within views and components.

User permissions to access dynamic attributes can be set in the security role editor in the same way as for regular attributes. Dynamic attributes are displayed with the + prefix.
