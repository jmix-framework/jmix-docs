= Integrating into Jmix UI

After creating the client-side and server-side parts of the component, it can be used in xref:views/views.adoc[views] by creating an instance of its Java class and adding it to a parent component.

Usually, the content of a view is defined in an XML file called a descriptor. Taking the Slider component implemented in xref:creating-components/js-component.adoc[] as an example, let's integrate it into the Jmix UI by adding XML support:

. Create the `app-ui-components.xsd` file and define the XML markup for the component:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/app-ui-components.xsd[tags=xsd-schema;!theme-toggle-schema]
----

. Create a component loader that is needed to initialize the component when it is used in the screen XML descriptors.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/component/SliderLoader.java[tags=slider-loader]
----
<1> The base class provides helper methods for loading attribute values.
<2> The `componentLoader()` method returns an instance of the `ComponentLoaderSupport` bean that provides methods for loading common attributes.

. To register the component and its loader with the framework, you need to create a Spring configuration class using the `@Configuration` annotation:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/ComponentRegistrationConfiguration.java[tags=component-registration-configuration;!theme-toggle-registration]
----

After that, the `Slider` component can be defined in the view's descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/customcomponent/jscomponent/js-component-view.xml[tags=slider-xml]
----
<1> The `xmlns` attribute specifies the xml namespace for a document. In this case with the `app` prefix.
<2> The `slider` element is added with namespace prefix.

[[studio-support]]
== Studio Support

To add Studio support you need to create an interface annotated with `@StudioUiKit` and a method annotated with `@StudioComponent`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/component/StudioComponents.java[tags=studio-components]
----

After that, Studio will show a new component in the *Add component* dialog:

And display available component properties:
