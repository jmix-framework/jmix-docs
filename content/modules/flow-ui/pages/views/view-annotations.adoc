* `@ViewController` annotation indicates that the class is a view. The value of the annotation is the view id which can be used to refer to the view from the xref:menu-config.adoc[main menu] or when opening the view programmatically.

* `@ViewDescriptor` annotation connects the view class to the XML descriptor. The value of the annotation specifies the path to the descriptor file. If the value contains a file name only, it is assumed that the file is located in the same package as the view class.

* `@com.vaadin.flow.router.Route` defines a URL path for navigation to this view. As long as the view should be opened inside the main view, the `layout` attribute specifies the main view class.

* `@DialogMode` annotation defines parameters of the dialog window when the view is opened as a dialog.

* `@com.vaadin.flow.server.auth.AnonymousAllowed` makes the view available without authentication. By default, only the login view is available to the anonymous (not authenticated) session.

TIP: See the https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-samples-2/tree/main/user-registration[User Registration^] sample project for how the `@AnonymousAllowed` annotation is used in a view for self-registration of users.
