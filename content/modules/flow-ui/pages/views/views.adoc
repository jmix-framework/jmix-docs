= Views

A _view_ is a basic building block of the application UI. It is a root of the hierarchy of visual components and can also contain data components, actions and facets.

A view is defined by a Java class. The class usually has a corresponding XML file called _descriptor_, which defines the view content. So there is a clear separation between declarative layout of components defined in XML and programmatic initialization and event handling logic written in Java.
