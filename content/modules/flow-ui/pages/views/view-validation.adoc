= View Validation

Data validation in UI views is performed by the `ViewValidation` bean. It contains methods for validating UI components, displaying validation errors and unsaved changes dialogs. It is used by views and dialogs of the framework and add-ons. You can use it in the application views as well.

Below we describe the main methods of the `ViewValidation` bean.

[[validateUiComponents]]
== validateUiComponents

The `validateUiComponents()` method accepts a collection of components or a component container. It runs validation for all passed components implementing the `SupportsValidation` interface and returns the `ValidationErrors` object which contains validation errors found for the validated components.

You can use this method in a view as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/validation/SampleView.java[tags=validateUiComponents]
----

[[showValidationErrors]]
== showValidationErrors

The `showValidationErrors()` method shows a notification with validation errors, if the passed `ValidationErrors` object is not empty. See the usage example above.

The notification title is defined by the message with the `validationFail.title` key. You can override the default message by specifying a message with this key in your project's message bundle, for example:

.messages_en.properties
[source,properties]
----
validationFail.title = Validation failed
----

[[showSaveConfirmationDialog]]
== showSaveConfirmationDialog

The `showSaveConfirmationDialog()` shows a confirmation dialog about saving or discarding unsaved changes. It is used by xref:views/views.adoc#standard-detail-view[entity detail views] when the user closes the view with unsaved changes and xref:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.view.use-save-confirmation[jmix.ui.view.use-save-confirmation] property is set to `true` (which is the default).

The dialog uses messages with the following keys:

* `dialogs.closeUnsaved.title` - the dialog header
* `dialogs.saveUnsaved.message` - the dialog text
* `dialogs.closeUnsaved.save` - "save" button text
* `dialogs.closeUnsaved.discard` - "discard" button text

You can override the default messages by specifying messages with the same keys in your project's message bundle, for example:

.messages_en.properties
[source,properties]
----
dialogs.closeUnsaved.title = You have unsaved changes
dialogs.saveUnsaved.message = Do you want to save changes before close?
dialogs.closeUnsaved.save = Save
dialogs.closeUnsaved.discard = Don't save
----

[[showUnsavedChangesDialog]]
== showUnsavedChangesDialog

The `showUnsavedChangesDialog()` shows a confirmation dialog about discarding unsaved changes. It is used by xref:views/views.adoc#standard-detail-view[entity detail views] when the user closes the view with unsaved changes and xref:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.view.use-save-confirmation[jmix.ui.view.use-save-confirmation] property is set to `false`.

The dialog uses messages with the following keys:

* `dialogs.closeUnsaved.title` - the dialog header
* `dialogs.closeUnsaved.message` - the dialog text

You can override the default messages by specifying messages with the same keys in your project's message bundle, for example:

.messages_en.properties
[source,properties]
----
dialogs.closeUnsaved.title = You have unsaved changes
dialogs.closeUnsaved.message = Do you want to discard unsaved changes?
----
