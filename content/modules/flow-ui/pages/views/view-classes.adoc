[[standard-list-view]]
== StandardListView

`StandardListView` is a base class for CRUD views displaying a list of entities. It can also be used as a lookup view to select entity instances from the list and return them to the caller. A list view usually uses the xref:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc[] or xref:vc/components/treeDataGrid.adoc[] components.
