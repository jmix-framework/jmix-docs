:page-aliases: screens/methods.adoc

In this section, we describe some methods of view controller base classes that can be invoked or overridden in the application code.

[[methods-of-all-views]]
== Methods of All Views

* `close()` - requests closing the view with the passed `StandardOutcome` enum value or a `CloseAction` object.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/myonboarding/MyOnboardingView.java[tags=close-with-discard]
----
+
The parameter value is propagated to the xref:views/view-events.adoc#before-close-event[BeforeCloseEvent] and xref:views/view-events.adoc#after-close-event[AfterCloseEvent], so the information about the reason why the view was closed can be obtained in the listeners.

* `closeWithDefaultAction()` - requests closing the view with `StandardOutcome.CLOSE`.

[[prevent-browser-tab-closing]]
* `setPreventBrowserTabClosing()` - sets whether this view should prevent the browser tab from closing accidentally if the xref:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.view.prevent-browser-tab-closing[jmix.ui.view.prevent-browser-tab-closing] property is set to `true` (which is `false` by default). Enabled by default for xref:views/view-classes.adoc#standard-detail-view[detail views].

* `getViewData()` - returns the `ViewData` object that serves as a registry for all xref:data-components.adoc[data components] defined in the view XML descriptor. You can use its `loadAll()` method to trigger all data loaders of the view:

----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/department/DepartmentListView.java[tags=view-data]
----

* `getViewAttributes()` - returns the `ViewAttributes` object that serves as a storage of named values. Uses `VaadinSession` as a store. For example, a detail view uses `ViewAttributes` to store the _read-only state_ and _locked status_ and revert these settings if a view is refreshed.

* `getPageTitle()` - returns the title of a view. By default, returns localized value defined in a view descriptor. Can be overridden to provide the title dynamically, for example:
+

----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/user/UserDetailView.java[tags=page-title]
----

* `beforeLeave()` - a callback that is executed before the navigation to another view is performed. Part of Vaadin's {vaadin-docs}/flow/routing/lifecycle/[navigation lifecycle^].
** The event allows the navigation to be _postponed_, _canceled_, or _changed_ to a different destination.
** Is not executed when a view is opened in a dialog mode.
** Must not be overridden without calling `super()` method as it executes framework related code.

* `beforeEnter()` - a callback that is executed before navigating to a view. Part of Vaadin's navigation lifecycle.
** Can be used to obtain the `Location` object and enables changing the navigation target to go to a different destination from the original one.
** Is not executed when a view is opened in a dialog mode.
** Must not be overridden without calling `super()` method as it executes framework related code.

* `afterNavigation()` - a callback that is executed after navigation has been completed. Part of Vaadin's navigation lifecycle.
** Can be used to obtain the `Location` object.
** Is not executed when a view is opened in a dialog mode.
** Must not be overridden without calling `super()` method as it executes framework related code.

[[methods-of-standard-list]]
== Methods of StandardListView

* `closeWithDiscard()` - requests closing the view with `StandardOutcome.DISCARD`.

* `getLookupComponent() / findLookupComponent()` - returns a component to be used for getting a value returned from this xref:views/view-classes.adoc#standard-list-view[lookup view]. By default, returns a component with an `id` specified by the xref:views/view-annotations.adoc#lookup-component[@LookupComponent] annotation.

* `setSelectionValidator()` - sets a predicate that tests if selected items can be processed by `SelectionHandler`.

* `setSelectionHandler()` - sets a callback that handles selected items. By default, adds items to a xref:data/collection-container.adoc[collection container] if a lookup view is opened for a xref:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc[] component or sets a single value if a lookup view is opened for a field, for example xref:vc/components/entityPicker.adoc[].

DialogWindow<View<?>> dialog = dialogWindows.lookup(ProjectDetailView.this, User.class) // <1>
        .withSelectHandler(users -> { // <2>
            for (User user : users) {
                ProjectParticipant projectParticipant = dataManager.create(ProjectParticipant.class);
                projectParticipant.setUser(user);
                projectParticipant.setProject(getEditedEntity());
                projectParticipant.setRole(projectRole);
                participantsDc.getMutableItems().add(projectParticipant);
            }
        })
        .build();

View<?> view = dialog.getView();
if (view instanceof MultiSelectLookupView multiSelectLookupView) { // <3>
    multiSelectLookupView.setLookupComponentMultiSelect(true);
}

dialog.open();
----
<1> Create a lookup view builder not bound to any UI component.
<2> Define selection handler for the lookup view.
<3> Check if actual lookup view supports multiple selection.

[[methods-of-standard-detail]]
== Methods of StandardDetailView

* `getEditedEntity()` - when the view is shown, returns an instance of the entity being edited. It’s the instance that is set in the data container specified in the xref:views/view-annotations.adoc#edited-entity-container[@EditedEntityContainer] annotation.
+
In the xref:views/view-events.adoc#init-event[InitEvent] listener, this method returns `null`. In the xref:views/view-events.adoc#before-show-event[BeforeShowEvent] listener, this method returns the instance passed to the view for editing (later in the view opening process the entity is reloaded and a different instance is set to the data container).

The following methods can be used to close the detail screen:

[[close-with-save-method]]
* `closeWithSave()` - validates and saves changes, then closes the view with `StandardOutcome.SAVE`. You can call this method from a custom event listener or add the built-in `detail_saveClose` action to the view.

* `closeWithDiscard()` - ignores any unsaved changes and closes the view with `StandardOutcome.DISCARD`. You can call this method from a custom event listener or add the built-in `detail_discard` action to the view.

If the view is closed using `close(StandardOutcome.CLOSE)` or `closeWithDefaultAction()` and has unsaved changes in its xref:data/data-context.adoc[DataContext], a dialog with a corresponding message will be displayed before the view is closed. You can adjust the notification type using the xref:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.view.use-save-confirmation[jmix.ui.view.use-save-confirmation] application property. If you use the `closeWithDiscard()` or `close(StandardOutcome.DISCARD)` methods, unsaved changes are ignored without any message.

* `hasUnsavedChanges()` - returns `true` if the view has unsaved changes. The default implementations checks if there are removed or modified entities in the `DataContext`. If only new entities have been registered as modified in the `DataContext`, checks whether they have been modified since the view was opened. You can override this method to provide additional checks or skip checking altogether and just return `false`.

* `save()` - validates and saves changes without closing the view. You can call this method from a custom event listener or add the built-in `detail_save` action to the view. Also, you can override the `save()` method to perform some operations after the data has been saved, for example:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/user/UserDetailView.java[tags=overridden-save-method]
----
<1> Call super method to execute the default logic.
<2> You can perform actions after the data has been saved.

* `setReloadSaved(boolean)` - sets whether edited entity should be reloaded after the xref:views/view-methods.adoc#close-with-save-method[closeWithSave()] method is invoked. The default value is `false`.
+
This method is invoked by the framework with `true` value when the view is opened in the dialog mode, to return the saved entity instance from the opened view. If you don't need to reload the saved entity in dialog mode, invoke `setReloadSaved(false)` in a xref:views/view-events.adoc#ready-event[ReadyEvent] listener.

* `setShowSaveNotification(boolean)` - sets whether a notification should be shown in case of a successful save. The default value is `true`.

* `setShowValidationErrors(boolean)` - sets whether to indicate about errors after components validation using the xref:views/view-validation.adoc#showValidationErrors[showValidationErrors()] method. The default value is `true`.

* `setCrossFieldValidationEnabled(boolean)` - sets whether cross-field validation should be performed before saving changes. It uses `UiCrossFieldChecks` xref:data-model:bean-validation.adoc#constraint-groups[constraint group] to validate the entity instance. The default value is `true`.

* `getLockStatus()` - Returns xref:pessimistic-lock:index.adoc[pessimistic lock] status of the currently edited entity instance. Possible variants:
** `LockStatus.NOT_SUPPORTED` - if the entity does not support pessimistic locking.
** `LockStatus.LOCKED` - if the entity instance is successfully locked.
** `LockStatus.FAILED` - if the lock failed because the entity is already locked by someone else.
