= Key-Value Containers
:page-aliases: data/key-value-containers.adoc

`KeyValueContainer` and `KeyValueCollectionContainer` are designed to work with xref:data-model:entities.adoc#key-value[key-value entities]. Such entities can contain an arbitrary number of attributes that are defined at runtime.

`KeyValueContainer` and `KeyValueCollectionContainer` can be defined in a view XML descriptor using `keyValueInstance` and `keyValueCollection` elements.

XML definition of a key-value container must include the `properties` element that defines the `KeyValueEntity` attributes (actually, keys and their types). The order of nested property elements should conform to the order of result set columns returned by the query. In the following example the `username` attribute will get its value from `us.user.username` column and the `stepsCount` attribute from `count(us)` column:

Besides, you can configure key-value containers using their Java API which includes the following methods:

* `addProperty()` - allows you to define the entity attributes (keys). The method accepts a name of the attribute and its type in the form of a xref:data-model:data-types.adoc[Datatype] or a Java class. In the latter case, the class should be either an entity class or a class supported by one of the datatypes. This method is used by the framework under the hood when you define properties of the key-value container declartively in XML as explained above.

* `setIdName()` is an optional method that allows you to define one of the attributes as an identifier attribute of the entity. It means that `KeyValueEntity` instances stored in this container will have identifiers obtained from the given attribute. Otherwise, `KeyValueEntity` instances get randomly generated UUIDs.

* `getEntityMetaClass()` returns a dynamic implementation of the xref:data-model:metadata.adoc[MetaClass] interface that represents the current schema of `KeyValueEntity` instances. It is determined by previous calls to `addProperty()`.
