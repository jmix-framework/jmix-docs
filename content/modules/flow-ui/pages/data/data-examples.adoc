= Using Data Components

This section provides practical examples of working with data components.

[[declarative-usage]]
== Declarative Usage

Usually, data components are defined and bound to visual components declaratively in the view XML descriptor. If you create a view for an entity using Studio, you can see the top-level `<data>` element which contains the data component declarations.

Below is an example of data components in a detail view for the `User` entity that has a to-one reference to `Department` and a to-many reference to the `UserStep` entity:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-detail-view-2.xml[tags=data]
----
<1> The root `data` element defines the xref:data/data-context.adoc[DataContext] instance.
<2> `InstanceContainer` of the `User` entity.
<3> The optional xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#fetch-plan[fetchPlan] attribute defines the object graph that should be eagerly loaded from the database.
<4> `InstanceLoader` that loads the `User` instance.
<5> `CollectionPropertyContainer` for the nested `UserStep` entity. It is bound to the `User.steps` collection attribute.
<6> A standalone `CollectionContainer` for the `Department` entity. It can be used as a source of dropdown items for selecting a department.
<7> `CollectionLoader` that loads the `Department` entity instances using the specified query.

The data containers defined above can be used in visual components as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-detail-view-2.xml[tags=components]
----
<1> Standalone fields have `dataContainer` and `property` attributes.
<2> The `formLayout` component propagates `dataContainer` to its fields, so they need only the `property` attribute.
<3> The `entityComboBox` field has also the `itemsContainer` attribute to get the list of dropdown items.
<4> `dataGrid` has only the `dataContainer` attribute.

[[programmatic-usage]]
== Programmatic Usage

Data components can be created and used in visual components programmatically.

In the example below, we create a detail view with the same data and visual components as defined in the previous section using only Java code without any XML descriptor.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/user/UserDetailViewProgrammatic.java[tags=progr]
----
<1> `DataComponents` is a factory to create data components.
<2> The `DataContext` instance is registered in the view for standard save action to work properly.
<3> The `userDl` loader will load data to `userDc` container.
<4> The `userDl` loader will merge loaded entities into the data context for change tracking.
<5> The `stepsDc` is created as a property container.
<6> A query is specified for the `departmentsDl` loader.
<7> `ContainerValueSource` is used to bind single fields to containers.
<8> `CollectionContainer` is directly used to provide items to combo boxes.
<9> `ContainerDataGridItems` is used to bind DataGrids to containers.
<10> `getEditedEntityContainer()` is overridden to specify the container instead of `@EditedEntityContainer` annotation.
<11> Loads data before opening the view. The edited entity id will be set to `userDl` by the framework automatically.

[[dependencies-between-data-components]]
== Dependencies Between Data Components

Sometimes you need to load and display data that depends on other data in the same view. For example, on the image below the left table displays the list of users (`User` entity) and the right one displays the list of onboarding steps (`UserStep` entity) for the selected user. The right list is refreshed each time the selected item in the left list changes.

image::data/dependent-tables.png[align="center"]

In this example, the `User` entity contains the `steps` attribute that is a one-to-many collection. So the simplest way to implement the view is to load the list of users with a xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#fetch-plan[fetch plan] containing the `steps` attribute and use a xref:flow-ui:data/property-containers.adoc[property container] to hold the list of dependent `UserStep` lines. Then bind the left table to the master container and the right table to the property container.

But this approach has the following performance implication: you will load `UserStep` instances for all users from the left table, even though you display the `UserStep` lines only for a single user at a time. This is why we recommend using property containers and deep fetch plans having collection attributes only when loading a single master item, for example, in the user detail view.

Also, the master entity may have no direct property pointing to the dependent entity. In this case, the above approach with a property container would not work at all.

The common approach to organize relations between data in a view is to use queries with parameters. The dependent loader contains a query with a parameter that links data to the master, and when the current item in the master container changes, you set the parameter and trigger the dependent loader.

Below is an example of the view which has two dependent container/loader pairs and the tables bound to them.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-with-steps-list-view.xml[tags=depend]
----
<1> Master container and loader.
<2> Dependent container and loader.
<3> The xref:flow-ui:facets/dataLoadCoordinator.adoc[DataLoadCoordinator] facet is not used, so we will trigger the loaders programmatically in the controller.
<4> Master table.
<5> Dependent table.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/user/UserWithStepsListView.java[tags=depend]
----
<1> The master loader is triggered in the `BeforeShowEvent` handler.
<2> In the `ItemChangeEvent` handler of the master container, a parameter is set to the dependent loader and it is triggered.

TIP: The xref:flow-ui:facets/dataLoadCoordinator.adoc[DataLoadCoordinator] facet allows you to link data components declaratively without writing any Java code.

// [[using-view-parameters-in-loaders]]
// == Using Screen Parameters in Loaders
//
// It is often required to load data in a view depending on parameters passed to that view. Below is an example of a browse view that accepts a parameter and uses it to filter the loaded data.
//
// Suppose we have two entities: `Country` and `City`. The `City` entity has the `country` attribute that is a reference to `Country`. The cities browser accepts a country instance and shows cities only of this country.
//
// First, consider the cities view XML descriptor. Its loader contains a query with a parameter:
//
// [source,xml,indent=0]
// ----
// include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/data/city-browse.xml[tags=loader]
// ----
//
// The cities view controller contains a public setter for the parameter and uses this parameter in the `BeforeShowEvent` handler.
//
// [source,java,indent=0]
// ----
// include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/data/CityBrowse.java[tags=controller]
// ----
//
// The cities view can be opened from another view passing a country as follows:

[[custom-sorting]]
== Custom Sorting

Sorting of UI tables by entity attributes is performed by `CollectionContainerSorter` which is set for a xref:flow-ui:data/collection-container.adoc[CollectionContainer]. The standard implementation sorts data in memory if it fits in one page of loaded data, otherwise it sends a new request to the database with the appropriate "order by" clause. The "order by" clause is created by the `JpqlSortExpressionProvider` bean.

Some entity attributes can require a special implementation of sorting. Below we explain how to customize sorting on a simple example: suppose there is the `Department` entity with a `num` attribute of type `String`, but we know that the attribute actually stores only numeric values. So we want the sort order to be `1`, `2`, `3`, `10`, `11`. With the default behavior, the order would be `1`, `10`, `11`, `2`, `3`.

First, create a subclass of the `CollectionContainerSorter` class for sorting in memory:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/app/CustomCollectionContainerSorter.java[]
----

Create the sorter in the required view:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/department/DepartmentListView2.java[tags=custom-sort]
----

If your sorter defines some global behavior, create your own factory that instantiates sorters system-wide:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/app/CustomSorterFactory.java[]
----

Also, you can create own implementation of `JpqlSortExpressionProvider` for sorting at the database level:

include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/app/CustomSortExpressionProvider.java[]
