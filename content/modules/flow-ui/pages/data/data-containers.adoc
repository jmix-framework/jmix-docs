= Data Containers
:page-aliases: data/data-containers.adoc

Data containers form a thin layer between visual components and the data model. They are designed to hold entity instances and collections, and provide information about the entity meta-class, fetch plan, and selected instance for collections. Data containers also allow you to register listeners to various events.
