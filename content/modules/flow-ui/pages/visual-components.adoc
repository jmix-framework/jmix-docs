= Visual Components

Jmix views are built from visual components that have server-side Java interface and can be declared in XML using corresponding XML elements.

For example, the following XML descriptor defines a view which displays a text field, a button and a label:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/simple1/simple-view-1.xml[tags=components]
----

In the Java class of the view, you can listen to the button click event, get the text field value and set it to the label:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/simple1/SimpleView1.java[tags=components]
----

As you can see, the text field component is represented by the `TypedTextField` class in Java. `TypedTextField` extends the Vaadin's {vaadin-docs}/components/text-field[TextField^] component and adds support for different value types, data binding and other Jmix-specific capabilities.

The label is the Vaadin's {vaadin-api}/com/vaadin/flow/component/html/Div.html[Div^] component, which represents the HTML `div` element.

In general, each visual component in Jmix consists of the following parts:

. Java class extending {vaadin-api}/com/vaadin/flow/component/Component.html[Component^]. It can be one of the Vaadin's standard {vaadin-docs}/components[components^], its extended version, or a completely new component based on {vaadin-api}/com/vaadin/flow/component/Composite.html[Composite^] or created from scratch.

. XML element for defining the component declaratively in view XML descriptors.

. Loader that reads the XML element and instantiates the component.

Items 2 and 3 are optional: you can just instantiate any subclass of `com.vaadin.flow.component.Component` in your view and add it to a parent component to show on the browser page. But when the component has an XSD and a loader class, it's much easier to use. Additionally, it can be exposed to Studio using a few annotations.

Studio allows you to build views in a visual designer with a preview, components structure and properties panels. When you click the *Add Component* button, Studio shows a palette of available components:
