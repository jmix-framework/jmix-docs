= Entity Picker Actions
:page-aliases: actions/standard-actions/entity-clear-action.adoc, actions/standard-actions/entity-lookup-action.adoc, actions/standard-actions/entity-open-action.adoc, actions/standard-actions/entity-open-composition-action.adoc

Entity picker actions work with the content of the xref:vc/components/entityPicker.adoc[] and xref:vc/components/entityComboBox.adoc[] components. These components implement the `EntityPickerComponent` interface.

When an entity picker action is added to the component, it is automatically represented by a button inside the field.

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/actions/standard-picker-actions-view.xml[tags=actions-1]
----

Below are the standard entity picker action types.

[[entity_clear]]
== entity_clear

Action class: `EntityClearAction`

Clears the value of the component.

If the component displays a one-to-one composition entity, the entity instance will also be removed on xref:data/data-context.adoc[] save (in entity detail views it happens when the user clicks *OK*).

[[entity_lookup]]
== entity_lookup

Action class: `EntityLookupAction`

Looks up an entity instance in the entity list view and sets it to the component.

[[entity_open]]
== entity_open

Action class: `EntityOpenAction`

Opens a detail view for the entity currently selected in the component.

[[entity_openComposition]]
== entity_openComposition

Action class: `EntityOpenCompositionAction`

Opens a detail view for the one-to-one composition entity selected in the component. If there is no linked entity at the moment (the component is empty), a new instance is created and saved by the detail view afterward.
