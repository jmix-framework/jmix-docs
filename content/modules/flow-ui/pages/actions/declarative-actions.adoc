= Declarative Actions

You can specify a set of actions in an XML screen descriptor for any component that implements the `HasActions` interface (xref:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc[], xref:vc/components/entityComboBox.adoc[], xref:vc/components/entityPicker.adoc[], and others), or in the view itself. You can do it in the `actions` element, which contains nested `action` elements.

In the example below, a set of actions is declared for a `dataGrid`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/actions/actions-view.xml[tags=dataGrid-action]
----
<1> `list_create` and `list_edit` actions are xref:actions/standard-actions.adoc[standard actions]. Their properties and behaviour are defined by their types.
<2> `sayHello` action properties are defined in-place. Its handler is defined in the view controller.
<3> Buttons associated with actions get their properties: text, icon, etc.

The `sayHello` action handler should be defined in the view controller:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/actions/ActionsView.java[tags=action]
----

The actions are displayed by the `dataGrid` as the context menu items:

[[attributes]]
== Action Attributes

The `action` element can have the following attributes:

* `id` - identifier, which should be unique within the `HasActions` component.

* `type` - defines an action type.
+
If this attribute is set, the framework finds a class having the `@ActionType` annotation with the specified value, and uses it to instantiate the action.
+
If the `type` attribute is not set, the framework creates an instance of the `BaseAction` class. See xref:actions/standard-actions.adoc[Standard Actions] for how to use action types provided by the framework and xref:actions/custom-action-type.adoc[Custom Action Types] for how to create your own types.

* `text` - action text. A linked button will use it to display the action.

* `description` - action description. A linked button will use its value for the xref:vc/common-attributes.adoc#title[title] attribute.

* `enabled` - whether the action and linked button are enabled: `true`, `false`.

* `visible` - whether the action and linked button are visible: `true`, `false`.

* `icon` - action icon. A linked button will display it.

* `actionVariant` - defines a variant of the action and sets the xref:vc/components/button.adoc#variants[variant] of the linked button: `DEFAULT`, `PRIMARY`, `DANGER`, `SUCCESS`.

* `shortcutCombination` - a keyboard shortcut to execute the action. It's a combination of key codes and modifiers separated by the "-" character. The key codes and modifiers are defined in the `com.vaadin.flow.component.Key` class. In the view XML, they should be used in upper case. For example:

== Obtaining Action in Controller

You can inject any declared in XML action into the view controller in the same way as other view components. It allows you to configure the action programmatically. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]

include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/actions/ActionsView.java[tags=action-inject]
