= Value Picker Actions

Value picker actions work with the content of the xref:vc/components/valuePicker.adoc[] and xref:vc/components/multiValuePicker.adoc[] components. These components implement the `PickerComponent` interface.

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/valuepicker/value-picker-view.xml[tags=basics]
----

image::visual-components/components/value-picker-basic.png[align="center",width="210"]

There are two standard actions in this category.

[[value_clear]]
== value_clear

Action class: `ValueClearAction`

Clears the value of the component.

[[multi_value_select]]
== multi_value_select

Action class: `MultiValueSelectAction`

For `multiValuePicker` component, opens a dialog window and sets the list of selected values to the component.

See details in the xref:vc/components/multiValuePicker.adoc#predefined-action[multiValuePicker] section.
