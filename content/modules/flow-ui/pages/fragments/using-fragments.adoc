= Using Fragments

This section explains how to define and use fragments. See also the xref:flow-ui:fragments/fragments.adoc#fragment-events[Fragment Events] section.

[[declarative-usage]]
== Declarative Usage

Suppose you have a fragment for entering an address:

.AddressFragment.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var1/AddressFragment.java[tags=fragment-java]
----

.address-fragment.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var1/address-fragment.xml[tags=fragment-xml]
----

TIP: A fragment can be created using the xref:studio:view-wizard.adoc[] in Studio. Select the `Blank fragment` template from the view templates list.

Then you can include it in a view using the `fragment` element with the `class` attribute specifying the fragment class FQN:

.host-view.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var1/host-view1.xml[tags=fragment-in-view]
----

The `fragment` element can be added to any layout component of the view, including the top-level `layout` element.

TIP: In Studio xref:studio:view-designer.adoc[], use the *Add Component* action to open the component palette. Find the `Fragment` component in it, then drag and drop it into the component structure or into the XML.

[[programmatic-usage]]
== Programmatic Usage

The same fragment can be included in a view programmatically using the `Fragments` bean, for example:

.host-view.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var1/host-view.xml[tags=fragment-in-view]
----

.HostView.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var1/HostView.java[tags=fragment-in-view]
----
<1> Injects the `Fragments` bean which is designed to instantiate fragments.
<2> Creates the fragmentâ€™s instance by its class.
<3> Add fragment instance to the `Details` layout component.

NOTE: If a fragment subscribes to a host view xref:fragments/fragments.adoc#fragment-autowiring[event], a fragment must be created and added to the view before this event is triggered.

[[passing-parameters-to-fragments]]
== Passing Parameters to Fragments

A fragment controller can have public setters to accept parameters as it is done when opening views, for example:

.AddressFragment.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var2/AddressFragment.java[tags=fragment-java]
----
<1> Setter methods allows you to pass parameters to the fragment.

If the fragment is added to the view declaratively in XML, use the `properties` element to pass the parameters, for example:

.host-view.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var2/host-view.xml[tags=fragment-in-view]
----
<1> Passes a data container to the `setCitiesContainer()` method.
<2> Passes a string parameter to the `setZipcodePlaceholder()` method.

Use the `value` attribute to specify values and the optional `type` attribute to indicate that the string value must be converted by one of the pluggable `PropertyParser` beans. Setters must have parameters of appropriate types.

[TIP]
====
To add a parameter in Jmix Studio, select `fragment` in the view descriptor XML or in the *Jmix UI* structure panel and click on the xref:studio:view-designer.adoc#component-inspector-add-button[Add]*->Properties->Property* button in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel.
====

If the fragment is created programmatically, setters can be invoked explicitly:

.HostView.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var2/HostView.java[tags=fragment-in-view]
----
<1> Passes a parameter before adding the fragment to the view.


[[using-data-components]]
== Using Data Components

A fragment can have its own data containers and loaders defined in the `data` XML element. At the same time, the framework creates a single instance of xref:flow-ui:data/data-context.adoc[DataContext] for the view and all its fragments. Therefore, all loaded entities are merged to the same context, and their changes are saved when the host view saves the data.

The following example demonstrates the usage of own data containers and loaders in a fragment.

Suppose you have a `City` entity, you want to show a drop-down list with available cities. You can define data components in the fragment descriptor as you would in a regular view:

.address-fragment.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var3/address-fragment.xml[tags=fragment-xml]
----

.AddressFragment.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var3/AddressFragment.java[tags=fragment-java]
----
<1> The fragment subscribes to the host view `BeforeShowEvent`, so fragment data will be loaded when the host view is opened.


[[provided-data-components]]
=== Provided Data Components

The next example demonstrates how to use data containers of the host view in a fragment.

.host-view.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var4/host-view.xml[tags=fragment-in-view]
----
<1> Data container that is used in the fragment below.

.address-fragment.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/address/var4/address-fragment.xml[tags=fragment-xml]
----
<1> `provided="true"` means that the container with the same id must exist in a host view or enclosing fragment.
<2> UI component is linked to the provided data container.

In the XML element having `provided="true"`, all attributes except id are ignored but can be present to provide information for design time tools.

A fragment can also define loaders, provided by a host view. A provided loader must have the same id as a loader of the host view, and `provided="true"` attribute. For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<loader id="addressDl" provided="true"/>
----
