<1> Defines the *root* element that is created automatically by the `Component` class and can be accessed using the `getElement()` method.
<2> Using `AbstractSinglePropertyField` as a base class which is suitable for creating components based on a single element's property.
<3> Passing the name of the element's property that refers to the value.
<4> Setting the `type` attribute value.
