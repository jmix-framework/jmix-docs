= Integrating JavaScript Library

You can create custom UI components based on third-party JavaScript libraries. This example demonstrates integration of the https://jqueryui.com/slider/[jQuery UI Slider^] widget.

[[web-component]]
== Creating a Web Component

Create the `slider.js` file in the `frontend/src/component/slider` folder. It contains a Web Component wrapping the *jQuery UI Slider* widget. Its `ready()` method is used to initialize the widget.

.slider.js
[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/frontend/src/component/slider/slider.js[tags=js-component]
----
<1> Defines base classes for custom component.
<2> Defines the name of HTML element.
<3> Defines custom properties.
<4> Defines listener on a property change.
<5> Gets the link to the root element.
<6> Initializes https://jqueryui.com/slider/[jQuery UI Slider^] on the root element.
<7> Dispatches custom event with the `custom-slide-changed` name.
<8> When a property is changed, it sets a new value for the slider.
<9> Exports custom HTML element with the name defined in the `static get is()` method.

[[creating-web-component-java-api]]
== Creating a Java API for a Web Component

Create the `Slider.java` file which is a UI component class. It defines an API for the server code, accessor methods, event listeners, and data sources connection.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/component/Slider.java[tags=js-component;!dom-event]
----
<1> Defines the *root* element that is created automatically by the `Component` class and can be accessed using the `getElement()` method. Must be the same as the Web Component exports.
<2> The `@NpmPackage` annotation defines an npm package dependency which includes one or more JS modules.
<3> The `@JsModule` annotation defines the import of the JavaScript module.
<4> Adding the `@Synchronize` annotation to the getter ensures that the browser sends property changes to the server. The annotation defines the name of the DOM event that triggers synchronization, in this case a `custom-slide-changed` event.

[[handling-client-side-events]]
== Handling Events from the Client-side

You can connect a component event to a DOM event that is fired by an element in the browser. To do this, use the `@DomEvent` annotation on your event class to specify the name of the DOM event you want to listen to. Vaadin Flow will automatically add a DOM event listener for the element if a component event listener exists.

An event can include additional information, such as the mouse button that was used in a click event. The `@DomEvent` constructor supports additional parameters. You can use `@EventData` to specify what data to send from the browser.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/component/Slider.java[tags=dom-event]
----

<1> Using the `@DomEvent` annotation to connect a Slider component to the `custom-slide-changed` DOM event.
<2> Using the `@EventData` annotation to define additional event data, the slider's value in this case.

TIP: More information about creating custom components can be found in Vaadin documentation: https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/advanced/loading-resources#using-annotations[Importing JavaScript & CSS^], https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/create-ui/web-components[Integrating Web Components^], https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/create-ui/element-api[Element API^].

== Usage Example

After a component is implemented it can be used in views, for example:
