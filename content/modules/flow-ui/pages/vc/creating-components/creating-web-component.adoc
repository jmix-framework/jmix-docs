= Creating Web Component

You can create https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/create-ui/web-components/introduction-to-webcomponents[Web Components^] from scratch based on https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/[Polymer 3^] or https://lit.dev/[LitElement^] libraries. After Web Component is implemented, you can create a Java API for it.

The example below shows how to build the light/dark theme toggle based on https://lit.dev/[LitElement^].

[[web-component]]
== Creating JavaScript Web Component

Create the `theme-toggle.js` file in the `frontend/src/component/theme-toggle` folder. It contains a Web Component implementing the light/dark theme toggle.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/frontend/src/component/theme-toggle/theme-toggle.js[tags=web-component]
----
<1> Defines base classes for custom components. Since `ThemeToggle` needs to look and behave like a button, one of the base classes is `ButtonMixin`, which provides properties and handlers specific to buttons.
<2> Defines the name of HTML element.
<3> Defines styles of the component as a combination of imported `vaadin-button` styles and custom styles.
<4> Defines Shadow DOM template
<5> Defines custom properties.
<6> Initializes `TooltipController` class that handles tooltip changes. Controller classes are used as delegates for repetitive functionality of visual components.
<7> Dispatches custom event with the `theme-changed` name.
<8> Exports custom HTML element with the name defined in the `static get is()` method.


[[creating-web-component-java-api]]
== Creating Java API for Web Component

Create the `ThemeToggle.java` file which is a UI component class. It defines an API for the server code, accessor methods, event listeners, and data sources connection.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/component/ThemeToggle.java[tags=web-component]
----
<1> Defines the *root* element that is created automatically by the `Component` class and can be accessed using the `getElement()` method. Must be the same as the Web Component exports.
<2> The `@JsModule` annotation defines the import of the JavaScript module.
<3> Using https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/create-ui/creating-components/mixins[Vaadin Mixin Interfaces^] to provide common APIs and default behavior for sets of functionalities found in most Web Components.
<4> Using the `@DomEvent` annotation to connect a ThemeToggle component to the `theme-changed` DOM event.
<5> Using the `@EventData` annotation to define additional event data, the theme value in this case.


TIP: More information about creating custom components can be found in Vaadin documentation: https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/create-ui/creating-components[Creating Components^], https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/create-ui/creating-components/mixins[Using Vaadin Mixin Interfaces^], https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/create-ui/creating-components/events[Using Events with Components&].

== Usage Example

After a component is implemented it can be used in views, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/customcomponent/themetoggle/ThemeToggleView.java[tags=component-usage]
