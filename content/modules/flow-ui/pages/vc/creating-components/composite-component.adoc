= Composite Component
:page-aliases: custom-components/composite-components.adoc

A composite component is a component consisting of other components. Like xref:fragments/fragments.adoc[fragments], composite components allow you to reuse some presentation layout and logic.

We recommend using composite components in the following cases:

* The functionality of a component can be implemented as a combination of existing visual components. +
If you need some non-standard features, xref:vc/creating-components/js-component.adoc[integrate a JavaScript library] or xref:vc/creating-components/creating-web-component.adoc[create a Web Component] from scratch.
* The component is relatively simple and does not load or save data itself. Otherwise, consider creating a fragment.

== Using Composite

In the example below, the `ColorComponent` component is created by combining the `ColorPicker` component, created in the xref:vc/creating-components/using-element-api.adoc[] section and a xref:vc/html-components/span.adoc[span] that displays its value:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/component/ColorComponent.java[tags=composite-component]
----
<1> The `Composite` base class is parameterized by the type of the root component.
<2> You can access the root component using the `getContent()` method.
<3> The `initContent()` method is called when the content of this composite is requested for the first time. This method should initialize the component structure for the composite and return the root component. By default, this method uses reflection to instantiate the component based on the generic type of the subclass.
<4> The public API of the composite component that delegates to the `colorPicker` component.

[[custom-field]]
== Using CustomField

https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/components/custom-field[CustomField^] is a base class for wrapping multiple components into a single field. It provides standard input field features such as label, helper, and validation. Use it to create custom input components.

The previous example can be rewritten as `CustomField`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/component/ColorField.java[tags=custom-field]
----

After a component is implemented it can be used in views, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/customcomponent/compositecomponent/CompositeComponentView.java[tags=composite-component-view;!composite-component]
----
