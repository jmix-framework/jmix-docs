= Integrating into Jmix UI

After creating the client-side and server-side parts of the component, it can be used in xref:views/views.adoc[views] by creating an instance of its Java class and adding it to a parent component.

Usually, the content of a view is defined in an XML descriptor. This section describes how to provide the ability to use the new component in XML and in Studio visual designer in the same way as standard Jmix UI components.

== Support in XML Descriptors

Below is an example of implementing XML support for the Slider component created in the xref:vc/creating-components/js-component.adoc[previous] section.

. Create the `app-ui-components.xsd` file and define the XML markup for the component:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/app-ui-components.xsd[tags=xsd-schema;!theme-toggle-schema]
----

. Create a component loader that is needed to initialize the component when it is used in the view XML descriptors.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/component/SliderLoader.java[tags=slider-loader]
----
<1> The base class provides helper methods for loading attribute values.
<2> The `componentLoader()` method returns an instance of the `ComponentLoaderSupport` bean that provides methods for loading common attributes.

. To register the component and its loader with the framework, you need to create a Spring configuration class using the `@Configuration` annotation:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/ComponentRegistrationConfiguration.java[tags=component-registration-configuration;!theme-toggle-registration]
----

After that, the `Slider` component can be defined in the view's descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/customcomponent/jscomponent/js-component-view.xml[tags=slider-xml]
----
<1> Define a namespace with the same value as in `xmlns` and `targetNamespace` attributes of the component's XSD.
<2> The `slider` element is added with namespace prefix.

[[studio-support]]
== Studio Support

To support the new component in Studio you need to create an interface annotated with `@StudioUiKit` and a method annotated with `@StudioComponent`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/component/StudioComponents.java[tags=studio-components]
----

After that, Studio will show a new component in the *Add component* dialog:

And display available component properties:
