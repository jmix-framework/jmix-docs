`genericFilter` component is a versatile tool to dynamically filter data.

The component enables <<quick-filter-example,quick data filtering>> with a set of temporary conditions, as well as creating <<configuration, configurations>> for repeated use.

* XML element: `genericFilter`

* Java class: `GenericFilter`

== Basics

The `genericFilter` component is added by default on some standard views, such as a xref:flow-ui:views/views.adoc#standard-list-view[list view] of an entity. A typical filter is shown below:

image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-anatomy.png[align="center", width="768"]

. [[refresh-button]] The *Refresh* button with the drop-down menu.
. [[operator-selector]] The comparison operator selector.
. [[filter-settings-button]] The *Filter Settings* button.
. [[refresh-drop-down-menu]] The list of saved filters and configurations.
. [[condition-field]] The condition value field.
. [[add-condition-link]] The *Add search condition* link.

To operate, `genericFilter` should be connected to a data loader of a standalone `CollectionContainer` or `keyValueCollectionContainer`. It generates a `Condition` object that is set to the loader and later processed by the xref:data-model:data-stores.adoc[data store]. For a xref:data-model:entities.adoc#jpa[JPA entity], the data store translates the resulting JPQL query, so that filtering is done on the database level, and then only the result is loaded from the database to the application memory.

The following example demonstrates basic `genericFilter` and some related components:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/genericfilter/generic-filter-view.xml[tags=data;customerDc;layout;generic-filter;customersTable]
----

<1> The data container holds the collections of `Customer` entity instances.
<2> The loader component declares a JPQL query to load all instances of `Customer`.
<3> The `genericFilter` component is bound to the loader through its `dataLoader` attribute.
<4> xref:flow-ui:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc[`dataGrid`] displaying the data from the data container. The list of records will change as they are filtered.

[[quick-filter-example]]
== Quick Filter Example

By default, the component is in quick filter mode. It means that a user can add a temporary set of conditions that only remains in effect for the duration of the current page session. After the page is closed, the conditions will disappear.

Letâ€™s assume that we have the `Customer` entity and want to:

* Create a quick filter with multiple conditions on the *Customer list* view.
* Save this filter for future use.

=== Creating a Quick Filter

* Click <<add-condition-link,*Add search condition*>>.
* Select the <<condition-types,properties>> to filter by. For example: *Age* and *Hobby*.
* Select an xref:flow-ui:vc/components/propertyFilter.adoc#operation[operator] and enter a value for each property.

image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-quick.png[align="center", width="860"]

=== Saving Configuration

* Click image:flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-settings-button.png[align="center", width="42"]-> *Save with values*.
* Enter a configuration name and click *OK* to save:
+
image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-save.png[align="center", width="562"]

This configuration can now be selected in the drop-down menu.

image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-refresh.png[align="center", width="390"]

To reset all currently applied conditions select the *<Reset filter>* menu option on top.

[[adding-conditions]]
== Adding Conditions

Click the *Add search condition* link [<<add-condition-link, 6>>] to open the *Add condition* dialog:

image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-add-condition-dialog.png[align="center", width="402"]

[[condition-types]]
Possible condition types are as follows:

* *Properties* -- attributes of this and related entities that can be used as filter properties. They are displayed according to the rules specified in the <<properties-element,properties>> element and may include both persistent and xref:dyn-attr:index.adoc[dynamic attributes].
+
* *Predefined conditions* -- conditions specified at design-time by the developer in the <<conditions-element,conditions>> element.
+
* *Configurations* -- existing filter configurations. They can be created either at <<design-time-configuration, design-time>> by the developer, or by the user at <<run-time-configuration,run-time>>.

Once a condition is added, it appears in the conditions panel. When a condition is no longer needed, it can be removed by clicking image:flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-remove.png[align="center", width="13"] next to it.

[[creating-conditions]]
== Creating Conditions

If there is no suitable condition yet, you can proceed to create it from the same dialog.
The drop-down actions of the *Create* button correspond to the xref:vc/components/genericFilter-components.adoc#filter-compponent-registration[registered] filter components.

image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-create-button.png[align="center", width="402"]

Three such components are available by default: xref:vc/components/genericFilter-components.adoc#property-filter[propertyFilter], xref:vc/components/genericFilter-components.adoc#jpql-filter[jpqlFilter], and xref:vc/components/genericFilter-components.adoc#group-filter[groupFilter].

Clicking an action opens a corresponding condition editor:

* <<property-conditions, Property conditions>> editor
* <<jpql-conditions, JPQL conditions>> editor
* <<group-conditions, Group conditions>> editor

TIP: Advanced xref:search:search-in-ui.adoc#fts-condition-in-filter-component[Full-text search condition] is available as a part the xref:search:index.adoc[Search] add-on.

[[property-conditions]]
=== Property Conditions

The *Property condition editor* allows users to set an entity attribute as a filter parameter and perform filtering against it. Use *Add search condition* -> *+ Create* -> *Create Property condition* to open the editor.

image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-property-condition-editor.png[align="center", width="514"]

The editor has the following controls and fields:

* *Property* -- accepts an entity attribute.
* *Operation* -- sets a comparison operator. The list displays only those operators that are compatible with the current property.
* *Parameter name* -- sets the name of the associated query parameter. Use this name to introduce dependencies between conditions of the same configuration. If not set, then parameter name is randomly generated.
* *Label* -- sets a custom label for this condition as it appears in the panel and editors.
* *Default value* -- sets a default value.
* *Operation editable* -- allows selecting a comparison operation type.
* *Operation text visible* -- sets whether the operation label is shown.
* *Visible* -- determines whether this condition is shown in the condition panel.

[[jpql-conditions]]
=== JPQL Conditions

The *JPQL condition editor* allows users to create condition based on JPQL expressions. Use *Add search condition* -> *+ Create* -> *Create JPQL condition* to open the editor.

image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-jpql-condition-editor.png[align="center", width="674"]

Field descriptions are provided below:

* *Parameter type* -- accepts a Java class representing the desired parameter type. You can also choose the `No parameter` option to create a condition without parameter.
+
image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-jpql-condition-editor-no-parameter.png[align="center", width="674"]
+
A condition with `No parameter` acts somewhat similar to a tag -- it filters out data based on a predefined, constant criterion.
+
* *Label* -- sets the label for this condition as it appears in the panel and editors.
* *Parameter name* -- sets the name of the associated query parameter. Use this name to introduce dependencies between conditions of the same configuration. If not set, then parameter name is randomly generated.
* *Default value* -- sets the default value for this condition. This field will be represented by the component compatible with the current value in *Parameter type*.
//todo: improve IN expression description upon completing jmix ticket #1442
* *Has IN expression* -- determines whether the condition can parse a collection and put it inside the `IN` clause.
* *Visible* -- determines whether this condition is shown in the filter panel.
* *Join* -- specifies an optional `join` clause to be included to the `from` clause of the data loader. This can be used to create a conditions based on an attribute of a related collection.
+
When writing this clause:

** Start with `join` or `left join` keywords.
** Use the `\{E}` placeholder instead of the entity alias.
+
For example:
+
----
join {E}.city c
----
* *Where* -- specifies the `where` clause to be added to the `select` query of the data loader.
+
When writing this clause:
+
** Use the placeholder `\{E}` instead of the entity alias.
** Set `?` as the parameter's value to indicate it is to be passed by the user. There can be only one such parameter in a condition. Besides, there can be any number of xref:data-access:jpql-extensions.adoc#session-and-user-attributes[session and user attributes] parameters.
+
For example:
+
----
{E}.code = ? and {E}.area = :session_area
----

[[group-conditions]]
=== Group Conditions

The *Group condition editor* allows users to combine conditions into a logical group. Use *Add search condition* -> *+ Create* -> *Create Property condition* to open the editor.

image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-group-condition-editor.png[align="center", width="1025"]

This editor has two areas -- one to configure group basic properties, and the other to add and show conditions currently in the group. The description of the fields in each area is given below.

==== Group condition

* *Operation* -- logical operator used to join conditions in a group. Group has two logical operators: *AND* or *OR*.
* *Label* -- sets the label for this condition as it appears in the conditions panel and editors. If not set, the name of the operation (*AND* or *OR*) is displayed instead.
* *Operation text visible* -- determines whether the name of the operation is displayed.
* *Visible* -- determines whether this group is shown in the filter panel.

==== Conditions

Conditions of the group are shown in the tree view. Use the following actions to manage them.

* *Add* -- opens the *Add condition* dialog letting you pick necessary ones.
* *Edit* -- opens an appropriate editor for a condition selected in the tree view.
* *Remove* -- removes all conditions that are currently selected in the tree view.
* image:flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-move-up.png[align="center", width="42"]/image:flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-move-down.png[align="center", width="42"]  -- buttons to change the order in which the conditions of the group appear.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

Configuration is a set of conditions saved for later use. It can include conditions of any type as well as another configuration.

Configurations can be created either at <<design-time-configuration, design-time>> by the developer, or by the user at <<run-time-configuration,run-time>>.

[[design-time-configuration]]
=== Design-time Configuration

A design-time configuration is a set of <<elements, nested elements>> of `genericFilter` in the XML view descriptor.

The following example declares `genericFilter` with two design-time configurations:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/genericfilter/generic-filter-view.xml[tags=design-time-configurations]
----

<1> Ensure that each configuration specifies an `id` attribute and its value is unique within this `genericFilter`. If the `name` attribute is not specified, `id` is treated as a key in the xref:localization:message-bundles.adoc[message bundle].
<2> The default configuration can be set the `default` attribute.

TIP: To add a design-time configuration in Jmix Studio, select the `genericFilter` component in the view descriptor or in the *Jmix UI* structure panel, then use xref:studio:view-designer.adoc#component-inspector-add-button[Add] -> *Configurations* -> *Design-time configuration* menu item of the *Component Inspector* panel.

A design-time configuration does not allow any user customizations at runtime and cannot be removed by the user. However, users can create an identical run-time configuration based on the design-time configuration and modify its parameters. This can be done with the image:flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-settings-button.png[align="center", width="42"] -> *Copy* menu action.

When the application is running, design-time configurations are displayed in the drop-down menu [<<refresh-drop-down-menu, 4>>] among other configurations.

image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-design-time-items.png[align="center", width="440"]

[[run-time-configuration]]
=== Run-time Configuration

Configurations can be created at runtime in the *Configuration editor*. To open the editor, use image:flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-settings-button.png[align="center", width="42"] -> *Edit* menu item.

NOTE: To create, edit, or remove a run-time configuration, the user needs to be granted with `ui.genericfilter.modifyConfiguration` security permission.

image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-run-time-configuration.png[align="center", width="1026"]

To create a run-time configuration:

* Specify a configuration name. This name is displayed in the drop-down menu [<<refresh-drop-down-menu, 4>>] and configuration editors.
[[avaialable-for-all-users]]
* Select the *Available for all users* checkbox to let anyone use the configuration. This checkbox is only available to users granted with [ui.filter.modifyGlobalConfiguration] permission.
* Select the *Default for all users* checkbox to automatically apply this configuration when users open the view. This checkbox is enabled if the *Available for all users* is selected.
* Configure the group operation and add conditions to the group. See the <<group-conditions, Group Conditions>> section for fields descriptions.

== Permissions

Advanced filter management requires the following permissions:

* To create/edit/delete genericFilter's configurations, the user must be granted `ui.genericfilter.modifyConfiguration` security permission.
* To create/edit/delete global (<<avaialable-for-all-users, available for all users>>) configurations, users must be granted `ui.genericfilter.modifyGlobalConfiguration` security permission.
* To create/change <<jpql-conditions,JPQL conditions>> in runtime, users must be granted `ui.genericfilter.modifyJpqlCondition` security permission.

== Application Properties

The following application properties affect the filter behavior:

* xref:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-auto-apply[jmix.ui.component.filter-auto-apply]
* xref:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-configuration-unique-names-enabled[jmix.ui.component.filter-configuration-unique-names-enabled]
* xref:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-properties-hierarchy-depth[jmix.ui.component.filter-properties-hierarchy-depth]

* xref:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-show-configuration-id-field[jmix.ui.component.filter-show-configuration-id-field]

== Creating Filter Programmatically

This section provides an example of `genericFilter` configuration created programmatically.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/component/genericfilter/GenericFilterView.java[tags=UiComponents;vbox;CollectionLoader;SingleFilterSupport;programmaticFilter]
----

<1> Creates `genericFilter` using the `uiComponents` factory.
<2> Adds a design-time configuration. The method takes two parameters: configuration id and configuration name.
<3> Creates a `PropertyFilter` instance and set its properties.
<4> Generates a component for this filter based on metaClass, property, and operation.
<5> Adds the filter to configuration. `LogicalFilterComponent` is the root element of the configuration.
<6> Puts `genericFilter` on the view inside the `vbox` layout. That layout is declared in the view descriptor and injected to the controller.
<7> Sets a current configuration.

[[applyShortcut]]
=== applyShortcut

Defines the keyboard shortcut that can be used to apply a filtering condition. This shortcut is only relevant when the filtering conditions are not set to be <<autoApply, automatically applied>>.

The default value is specified by the xref:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-apply-shortcut[jmix.ui.component.filter-apply-shortcut] property.

[[autoApply]]
=== autoApply

Specifies whether the filter is applied automatically.

* If set to `true`, filter is applied immediately after updating a filtering condition or any time it loses focus.
* If set to `false`, filter will be applied only after the button [<<refresh-button, 1>>] is clicked or <<applyShortcut, applyShortcut>> is used. Note that setting the value to `false` updates the button text to *Apply*.

The default value is specified by the xref:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-auto-apply[jmix.ui.component.filter-auto-apply] property.

[[dataLoader]]
=== dataLoader

Sets a xref:flow-ui:data-components.adoc[data loader] that will load data based on the filtering condition.

[[opened]]
=== opened

Specifies whether the condition panel is open.

[[propertyHierarchyDepth]]
=== propertyHierarchyDepth

Sets the number of nested levels at which the filter is applied. Any reasonable, non-zero number of levels can be specified. The default is `2`.

image::visual-components/components/generic-filter-hierarchy-depth.png[align="center" width="405"]

* `propertyHierarchyDepth = "1"` â€“ filters through immediate properties of the entity.
* `propertyHierarchyDepth = "2"` â€“ filters through properties of the entity as well as the properties of any child entities.
* `propertyHierarchyDepth = "3"` â€“ filters through immediate properties of the entity and up to the third nested level of properties.

This value can be specified globally for all filter components by setting the xref:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-auto-apply[jmix.ui.component.filter-properties-hierarchy-depth] property.

[[summaryText]]
=== summaryText

Specifies a short summary to be displayed above the filter control panel. The default value is `Filter`.

== Handlers

<<ConfigurationChangeEvent, ConfigurationChangeEvent>> -
<<ConfigurationRefreshEvent, ConfigurationRefreshEvent>> -
xref:vc/common-handlers.adoc#DetachEvent[DetachEvent] -
<<OpenedChangeEvent, OpenedChangeEvent>> -
<<propertyFiltersPredicate, propertyFiltersPredicate>>

[[ConfigurationChangeEvent]]
=== ConfigurationChangeEvent

`ConfigurationChangeEvent` is sent whenever one filter configuration is switched for another. This includes switching to a configuration when no configuration is set, or resetting the configuration.

[[ConfigurationRefreshEvent]]
=== ConfigurationRefreshEvent

`ConfigurationRefreshEvent` is sent every time the filter configuration is edited.

[[OpenedChangeEvent]]
=== OpenedChangeEvent

`OpenedChangeEvent` is sent every time the <<opened, opened>> attribute of the component changes.

[[propertyFiltersPredicate]]
=== propertyFiltersPredicate

This predicate allows to programmatically include or exclude attributes available for user selection.

For example, to exclude `hobby` from user selection use the following code:

xref:vc/components/tooltip.adoc[tooltip]

[[actions-element]]
=== actions

Defines the list of actions for filter management. The framework provides the following default actions available in the *Filter Settings* image:flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-settings-button.png[align="center", width="42"] menu:

* *Save* -- saves changes to current configuration. Implemented by `FilterSaveAction` (`type="genericFilter_save"` in XML).
* *Save with values* -- saves changes to current configuration along with the values in the condition fields [<<condition-field, 5>>] as their default values.
* *Save as* -- saves current configuration under a different name. Implemented by `FilterSaveAsAction` (`type="genericFilter_saveAs"` in XML).
* *Edit* -- opens editor for current <<run-time-configuration, run-time>> configuration. Disable for <<design-time-configuration, design-time>> configurations. Implemented by `FilterEditAction` (`type="genericFilter_edit" in XML).
* *Remove* -- removes current <<run-time-configuration, run-time>> configuration. Disabled for <<design-time-configuration, design-time>> configurations. Implemented by `FilterRemoveAction` (`type="genericFilter_remove" in XML).
* *Copy* -- creates a <<run-time-configuration, run-time>> copy for the current configuration. Implemented by `FilterCopyAction` (`type="genericFilter_copy" in XML).
* *Clear values* -- clears the values in the condition fields [<<condition-field, 5>>]. Implemented by `FilterClearValuesAction` (`type="genericFilter_clearValues" in XML).
* *Add* -- adds a condition to the current configuration. Implemented by `FilterAddConditionAction` (`type="genericFilter_addCondition" in XML).
* *Reset* -- resets  Implemented by `FilterResetAction` (`type="genericFilter_reset" in XML).

Developers can override the list of actions in the image:flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-settings-button.png[align="center", width="42"] menu:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/genericfilter/generic-filter-view.xml[tags=filter-with-actions]
----

The example above creates a filter with two menu actions:

image::flow-ui:visual-components/components/generic-filter-settings-menu-actions.png[align="center", width="242"]

[[conditions-element]]
=== conditions

Holds a declaration of <<condition-types, predefined conditions>>.

See the following example for illustration:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/genericfilter/generic-filter-view.xml[tags=filter-with-condition]
----

[[configurations-element]]
=== configurations

Holds a declaration of <<design-time-configuration, design-time configurations>>.

[[properties-element]]
=== properties

Determines which entity attributes can be added to condition. This element has the following attributes:

* `include` -- specifies a regular expression. Entity attributes that match this expression are included.
* `exclude` -- specifies a regular expression. Entity attributes that match this expression are excluded.
* `excludeProperties` -- specifies a comma-separated list of property names or property paths that should be excluded. For example: `customer.name`.
* `excludeRecursively` -- determines whether the attribute in `excludeProperties` must be recursively excluded for the whole object graph. That is, if 'true', any children attributes of the excluded attribute are excluded as well.

See the following example for illustration:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/genericfilter/generic-filter-view.xml[tags=filter-with-properties]
----

[TIP]
====
You can include and exclude collection (`@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`) properties.
====

[NOTE]
====
You can include and exclude xref:dyn-attr:index.adoc[dynamic attributes] as a filtering condition. This doesn't require the xref:dyn-attr:dynattr-view.adoc#using-dynamicattributes-facet[dynamicAttributes] facet on that view.

Specify the attribute's code with a + prefix:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::dyn-attr:example$dyn-attr-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/car/car-list-view.xml[tags=exclude-dynamic-attribute]
----

Note that if such attribute is an entity, rather than a simple value, you cannot use the attributes of that entity as part of a filtering condition.
====

The following entity attributes are ignored:

* Not accessible due to security permissions
* Non-persistent attributes
* Attributes annotated with `@SystemLevel`
* Attributes of `byte[]` type

[[responsive-steps]]
=== responsiveSteps

Determines the number of columns to display search conditions based on the available space. By default, search conditions are arranged in two columns and adjust to a single column when the layout width is smaller.

The following filter overrides the default behaviour to adjust the layout to one, two, or three columns with labels positioned on top:
