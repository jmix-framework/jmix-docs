An input field to select an xref:data-model:entities.adoc[entity] instance through a dialog and perform various actions on it. These can be both predefined actions such as updating instance details, as well as custom, configurable actions to perform more specific tasks.

* XML element: `entityPicker`

* Java class: `EntityPicker`

== Basics

The `entityPicker` component is commonly used when the field value must represent a reference to an entity. It combines the ability to select a particular entity instance with the ability to perform relevant actions.

Clicking the lookup button opens a dialog with a xref:views/views.adoc#standard-list-view[list view] containing entity instances.

| image::visual-components/components/entity-picker-basic-2.png[align="center", width="806"]
|===

Like other views in the application, this view is configurable, allowing multiple attributes to help users easily identify the needed instance. It provides more context than the xref:vc/components/entityComboBox.adoc[] which only shows instance names.

When the number of instances is large, additional instances are loaded dynamically as you navigate the list.

[[quick-start]]
== Quick Start

The following example demonstrates how to use the `entityPicker` component to select the department the user belongs to:

NOTE: For the example to work correctly, ensure that you define a xref:views/views.adoc#standard-list-view[list view] for the Department entity.

----

<1> Data container to hold the User instance which is currently being edited.
<2> Fetch plan extended to retrieve a collection of Department instances that will be available for selection.
<3> Data load coordinator to automatically supply the component with instances to select from.
<4> Binding the component to a data container and property.
<5> Adding a predefined action to open the lookup view.
<6> Adding a predefined action to clear the selection.

== Data Binding

Data binding refers to linking a visual component to a data container. Changes in the visual component or corresponding data container can trigger updates to one another. See xref:data/data-examples.adoc[] for more details.

=== Select an instance

If you simply need a way to select an instance of a specific entity, specify that entity using the <<metaClass,metaClass>> attribute:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/entitypicker/entity-picker-view.xml[tags=binding-metaclass]
----

=== Select an instance to update a related attribute

Selecting an instance is often intended to update an attribute within another instance. In the <<quick-start, example above>>, selecting a `Department` instance updates the `User` instance by associating it with the chosen department.

In such cases you will need to bind the component to the data container holding the instance and specify the attribute to be updated using the xref:vc/common-attributes.adoc#dataContainer[dataContainer] and xref:vc/common-attributes.adoc#property[property] attributes respectively:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/entitypicker/entity-picker-view.xml[tags=binding-container]
----

[[actions]]
== Actions

You can define custom and predefined actions for `entityPicker` displayed as buttons on the right.
You can do it either in the XML descriptor using the `actions` nested element or programmatically in the controller using the `addAction()` method.

[TIP]
====
To add `action` in Jmix Studio, select the component in the screen descriptor XML or in the *Jmix UI* structure panel and click on the xref:studio:screen-designer.adoc#add-picker-action[Add] button in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel.
====

[[predefined-action]]
=== Predefined Action

When Studio generates `entityPicker` in the detail view, it also generates two predefined standard actions: `entity_lookup` and `entity_clear`. There are also the `entity_open` and `entity_openComposition` actions.

Use the `type` and `id` attributes for declaring predefined action in XML.

If you create `entityPicker` without actions, the XML loader will define only the `entity_lookup` and `entity_clear` actions. To add another predefined action, for example, the `entity_open`, you should specify the `actions` element as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/entitypicker/entity-picker-view.xml[tags=actions]
----

The `actions` element does not extend but overrides a set of standard actions. You should define the identifiers of all required actions explicitly.

[[custom-actions]]
=== Custom Actions

To define a custom action in XML, use the `actions` nested element. Specify the `id` and `icon` attributes for the `action`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/entitypicker/entity-picker-view.xml[tags=custom]
----

Then implement custom logic in the view controller by subscribing to `ActionPerformedEvent`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/component/entitypicker/EntityPickerView.java[tags=departmentEntityPicker;notifications;onKnowManager]
----

[TIP]
====
You can generate the `ActionPerformedEvent` handler implementation stub using Studio.
====

[[add-actions-programmatically]]
=== Adding Actions Programmatically

Use the `addAction()` method to set actions programmatically.

* *Adding Standard Action*
+
For example, if the component is defined in the XML descriptor without the `actions` nested element, it is sufficient to add missing standard actions:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/component/entitypicker/EntityPickerView.java[tags=departmentEntityPicker;actions;onInit;addAction]
----

* *Adding Custom Action*
+
An example of creating a custom action:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/component/entitypicker/EntityPickerView.java[tags=departmentEntityPicker;onInit;addCustomAction]

[[metaClass]]
=== metaClass

You can use `entityPicker` without binding to the data container, that is, without setting `dataContainer` and `property`. In this case, the `metaClass` attribute should be used to specify an entity type for `entityPicker`. For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/entitypicker/entity-picker-view.xml[tags=metaClass]
----

You can get an instance of a selected entity by injecting the component into a controller and invoking its `getValue()` method.
