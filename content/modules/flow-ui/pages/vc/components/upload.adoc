`upload` allows users to upload one or multiple files. It displays the upload progress and the status of each file. Files can be uploaded by clicking the *Upload files* button or by dragging them onto the component.

== Basics

An example of `upload`:

----

image::visual-components/components/upload-basics.png[align="center", width="332"]

[[auto-upload]]
== Auto-Upload

The `autoUpload` attribute determines whether files should be uploaded automatically as soon as they are selected, or if the user needs to explicitly trigger the upload.

* When `true`, files are uploaded immediately after selection. The upload progress bar is displayed, and the user can cancel the upload if needed.
* When `false`, files are not uploaded automatically. The user must click the *Upload* button to start the upload process.

The default value is `true`.

[[drag-drop]]
== Drag & Drop

The `upload` component supports drag and drop functionality, allowing users to upload files by simply dragging them from their file system and dropping them onto the component.

Drag & drop functionality is enabled by default. To disable it, set the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/fileStorageUploadField.adoc#dropAllowed[dropAllowed] attribute to `false`.

The `dropLabel` attribute allows you to customize the message that prompts users to drop files into the upload area.

The attribute value can either be the text itself or a key in the xref:localization:message-bundles.adoc[message bundle]. In case of a key, the value should begin with the `msg://` prefix.

The `dropLabelIcon` attribute allows you to specify an icon to be displayed along with the `dropLabel` text.

[[file-count]]
== File Count

By default, `upload` doesn't have a limit on the number of files that can be uploaded. You can set a file count limit using the `maxFiles` attribute.

This attribute specifies the maximum number of files to upload. If the value is set to one, the native file browser will prevent selecting multiple files.

Exceptions that arise arenâ€™t shown in the UI by default. Use <<FileRejectedEvent,FileRejectedEvent>> to catch those exceptions and, for example, a notification to inform the user of the problem.

[[receivers]]
== Receivers

The `receiverFqn` attribute specifies the fully qualified name of the Java class that will handle the uploaded files. This class must implement the `Receiver` interface.

NOTE: If the receiver doesn't implement `MultiFileReceiver` then the `upload` will be automatically set to only accept one file.

The `receiverType` attribute specifies the type of receiver used for handling uploaded files. It determines how the uploaded files will be processed and stored. Possible values are:

* `MemoryBuffer`
+
Handles a single file upload at once. Writes the file data into an in-memory buffer. Using `MemoryBuffer` automatically configures the component so that only a single file can be selected.
* `MultiFileMemoryBuffer`
+
Handles multiple file uploads at once. Writes the file data into a set of in-memory buffers.
* `FileTemporaryStorageBuffer`
+
Handles a single file upload at once. Saves a file to the xref:files:file-storage.adoc[temporary storage]. Using `FileTemporaryStorageBuffer` automatically configures the component so that only a single file can be selected.
* `MultiFileTemporaryStorageBuffer`
+
Handles multiple file uploads at once. For each, it saves a file to the xref:files:file-storage.adoc[temporary storage].

The default receive type is `MemoryBuffer`.

== Attributes

In Jmix there are many xref:vc/common-attributes.adoc[common attributes] that serve the same purpose for all components.

The following are attributes specific to `upload`:

[cols="1h,5,1", grid=rows, frame=none]
|===
|*Name*
|*Description*
|*Default*
|[[autoUpload]]autoUpload
|Sets whether the component allows uploads to start immediately after selecting files. See <<auto-upload,Auto-Upload>>.
|`true`
|[[dropLabel]]dropLabel
|Specifies the drop label to show as a message to the user to drop files in the `upload` component. See <<drag-drop,Drag & Drop>>.
|
|[[dropLabelIcon]]dropLabelIcon
|Sets the icon for the drop label. The icon is visible when the user can drop files to this `upload` component. See <<drag-drop,Drag & Drop>>.
|
|[[maxFiles]]maxFiles
|Specifies the maximum number of files to upload. See <<file-count,File Count>>.
|unlimited
|[[receiverFqn]]receiverFqn
|Sets the receiver implementation that should be used for this `upload` component. See <<receiver,Receivers>>.
|
|[[receiverType]]receiverType
|Specifies the type of the `Receiver` implementations. See <<receiver,Receivers>>.
|`MemoryBuffer`
|===

== Handlers

In Jmix there are many xref:vc/common-handlers.adoc[common handlers] that are configured in the same way for all components.

The following are handlers specific to `upload`.

include::../handler-generation-tip.adoc[]

[cols="1h,6", grid=rows, frame=none]
|===
|*Name*
|*Description*
|[[AllFinishedEvent]]AllFinishedEvent
|`com.vaadin.flow.component.upload.AllFinishedEvent` is sent when `upload` has processed all the files in its upload queue, regardless of whether all the receptions were successful or not.
|[[FailedEvent]]FailedEvent
|`com.vaadin.flow.component.upload.FailedEvent` is sent when `upload` is received, but the reception is interrupted for some reason.
|[[FileRejectedEvent]]FileRejectedEvent
|`com.vaadin.flow.component.upload.FileRejectedEvent` is sent when the file selected for upload doesn't meet the constraints specified on `upload`, for example, xref:flow-ui:vc/components/fileStorageUploadField.adoc#maxFileSize[file size limit] or <<maxFiles,file count limit>>. See <<file-count,File Count>>.
|[[FinishedEvent]]FinishedEvent
|`com.vaadin.flow.component.upload.FinishedEvent` is sent when `upload` receives a file, regardless of whether the reception was successful or failed. If you wish to distinguish between the two cases, use either <<SucceededEvent,SucceededEvent>> or <<FailedEvent,FailedEvent>>, which are both subclasses of `FinishedEvent`.
|[[ProgressUpdateEvent]]ProgressUpdateEvent
|`com.vaadin.flow.component.upload.ProgressUpdateEvent` is sent to track progress of upload.
|[[StartedEvent]]StartedEvent
|`com.vaadin.flow.component.upload.StartedEvent` is sent when `upload` is started to receive.
|[[SucceededEvent]]SucceededEvent
|`com.vaadin.flow.component.upload.SucceededEvent` is sent when `upload` is received successfully. Our Samples demo application includes an https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/upload[example^] that utilizes a `MultiFileMemoryBuffer` to manage multiple files in `com.vaadin.flow.component.upload.SucceededEvent`.
|[[receiver]]receiver
|Sets the receiver implementation that should be used for this `upload` component. See the <<receiverFqn,receiverFqn>> and <<receiverType,receiverType>> attributes.
