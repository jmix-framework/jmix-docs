An application theme can be used in multiple applications by packaging it as a JAR dependency.

The theme add-on project's file structure looks as follows:

.Theme add-on file structure
image::themes/theme-addon-structure.png[align="center"]

* `cobalt` - the theme folder, also used as theme name
* `styles.css` - the master stylesheet
* `theme.json` - a theme configuration file. It's recommended to define *jmix-lumo* as the parent theme, so your custom theme includes *jmix-lumo* styles required for proper work of Jmix UI components and views.

After theme add-on is added as a dependency to the project, the packaged theme can be used as a standalone theme:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Theme(value = "cobalt")
public class MyProjectApplication implements AppShellConfigurator {
    ...
}
----

or as a parent for the project's themes, for example:

[source,json,indent=0]
.theme.json
----
{
  "parent": "cobalt",
  "lumoImports":["typography","color","spacing","badge","utility"]
}
----

In this case, the project's theme will load on top of the base theme, extending it.
