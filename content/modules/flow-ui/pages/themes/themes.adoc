= Themes

Themes are used to manage the visual presentation of the application.

A theme consists of CSS files and other resources like images and fonts.

Jmix provides *jmix-lumo* theme built on top of Vaadin https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/styling/lumo[Lumo theme^].

[[applying-theme]]
== Applying a Theme

The application theme is applied using the `@Theme` annotation with the name of the theme folder as a parameter. The `@Theme` annotation must be placed on the class that implements the `AppShellConfigurator` interface, which is usually the main application class.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Theme(value = "my-theme")
public class MyProjectApplication implements AppShellConfigurator {
    ...
}
----

A theme variant can be specified as an additional parameter, such as *dark* or *light*.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Theme(value = "my-theme", variant = "dark")
public class MyProjectApplication implements AppShellConfigurator {
    ...
}
----

NOTE: Themes cannot be switched at runtime. Although a project may have multiple themes, only one can be applied for the UI. However, there are ways to https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/styling/advanced/runtime-theme-switching[switch between variants^] of the same theme and https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/styling/advanced/loading-styles-dynamically[load dynamically additional styles^] on top of a theme.

[[application-theme]]
== Application Theme

For use in an application, the theme folder is placed inside the `frontend/themes` folder, with a name of your choosing. Jmix application projects created using Studio have a predefined theme folder with the same name as the project itself.

.Theme folder file structure
image::themes/theme-folder-structure.png[align="center", width="285"]

* `my-project` - the theme folder, also used as theme name
* `styles.css` - the master stylesheet
* `my-project.css` - an entry point for custom styles and imports
* `theme.json` - a theme configuration file, which by default defines *jmix-lumo* as the default theme.

`styles.css` is the entry point to the theme's styles. All CSS, including *Lumo* style property values and custom component styles, can be added there.

It can be useful to split CSS into multiple files to avoid cluttering the main stylesheet. Additional CSS files are loaded using `@import` directives. By default, the project's master stylesheet contains a single import of `<theme-name>.css` file that defines your styles and any other imports.

[source,css,indent=0]
.styles.css
----
@import url('./my-project.css');

== Reusable Theme

<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">

</div>

An application theme can be used in multiple applications by packaging it as a JAR dependency.

The theme project's structure looks as follows:

.Theme project structure
image::themes/theme-addon-structure.png[align="center", width="296"]

* `cobalt` - the theme folder, also used as theme name
* `styles.css` - the master stylesheet. Can contain custom styles and imports, for example:
+
[source,css]
----
html {
    --lumo-border-radius: calc(var(--lumo-size-m) / 2);

    --lumo-primary-color: rgb(0, 85, 166);
    --lumo-primary-color-50pct: rgba(0, 85, 166, 0.5);
    --lumo-primary-color-10pct: rgba(0, 85, 166, 0.1);
    --lumo-primary-text-color: rgb(0, 85, 166);
}
----
* `theme.json` - a theme configuration file. It's recommended to define *jmix-lumo* as the parent theme, so your custom theme includes *jmix-lumo* styles required for proper work of Jmix UI components and views. For example:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "parent": "jmix-lumo",
  "lumoImports":["typography","color","spacing","badge","utility"]
}
----

The `build.gradle` file of the theme add-on project may look as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'com.gradle.plugin-publish' version '1.2.1'
}

group = 'com.company'
version = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url 'https://global.repo.jmix.io/repository/public'
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'io.jmix.flowui:jmix-flowui-themes:2.3.0' // <1>
}
----
<1> Dependency to `jmix-flowui-themes` that contains *jmix-lumo* theme.

After the theme JAR is added as a dependency to the project, the packaged theme can be used as a standalone theme:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Theme(value = "cobalt")
public class MyProjectApplication implements AppShellConfigurator {
    ...
}
----

or as a parent for the project's themes, for example:

[source,json,indent=0]
.theme.json
----
{
  "parent": "cobalt",
  "lumoImports":["typography","color","spacing","badge","utility"]
}
----

In this case, the project's theme will load on top of the base theme, extending it.

[[pluggable-styles]]
== Pluggable Styles

When developing a xref:modularity:creating-add-ons.adoc[custom add-on], you can create a file with custom styles in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/` directory. To add these styles to the resulting application, define the `jmix.ui.export-styles` property in the `module.properties` file. The value of this property is a path relative to `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/`, for example, `jmix.ui.export-styles = addon-styles/my-addon-styles.css`:

.my-addon-styles.css
[source,css]
----
.test {
    color: red;
}
----

Custom styles are added as `<style type="text/css">` to the `<head>` element:

[source,html,indent=0]
----
<style type="text/css">
.test {
    color: red;
}
</style>
----

IMPORTANT: Use this approach only for a small number of styles that cannot be applied to a particular UI component. For example, for CSS utility classes of views inside an add-on.

[[changing-theme-variants-at-runtime]]
== Changing Theme Variants at Runtime

To switch between theme variants, e.g. *light* and *dark*, the framework provides a static helper class that works in conjunction with the JavaScript file.

The `ThemeUtils` class provides methods for switching theme variants, which effectively means setting the theme variant in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage[Web Local Storage^] and invoking JavaScript code to apply it.

For example, you can add a xref:flow-ui:vc/components/dropdownButton.adoc[dropdownButton] to the main view and switch between theme variants:

.main-view.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/main/main-view.xml[tags=theme-switcher]
----

.MainView.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/main/MainView.java[tags=theme-switcher]
----

.ThemeSwitcher component
image::themes/theme-switcher.png[align="center", width="173"]

The JavaScript file provides code that applies a theme variant to an HTML document depending on the value in the Web Local Storage and subscribes to the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme[prefers-color-scheme^] to update the theme variant if the user indicates their preference through an operating system setting (e.g., light or dark mode) or the user agent's settings.

You need to import it into the main application class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/OnboardingApplication.java[tags=js-file-import;main-class]
----
