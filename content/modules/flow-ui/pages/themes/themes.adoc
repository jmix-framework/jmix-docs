== Applying a Theme

The application theme is applied using the `@Theme` annotation with the name of the theme folder as a parameter. The `@Theme` annotation must be placed on the class that implements the `AppShellConfigurator` interface. By default, it's the main application class.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Theme(value = "my-theme")
public class MyProjectApplication implements AppShellConfigurator {
    ...
}
----

The theme variant can be provided as an additional parameter, e.g. dark or light.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Theme(value = "my-theme", variant = "dark")
public class MyProjectApplication implements AppShellConfigurator {
    ...
}
----

NOTE: Themes cannot be switched at run-time. Even though a project may contain multiple themes, only one can be applied to the UI. However, there are ways to https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/styling/advanced/runtime-theme-switching[switch between variants^] of the same theme, https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/styling/advanced/loading-styles-dynamically[load dynamically additional styles^] on top of the theme.

== Application Theme

For use in an application, the theme folder is placed inside the `frontend/themes` folder, with a name of your choosing. Jmix application projects created by Studio have a predefined theme folder with the same name as the project itself.

* `my-project` - the theme folder, also used as theme name
* `styles.css` - the master stylesheet
* `my-project.css` - an entry point for custom styles and imports
* `theme.json` - a theme configuration file. By default, defines jmix-lumo as the parent theme.

`styles.css` is the entry point to the theme styles. All CSS, including *Lumo* style property values and custom component styles, can be added there.

It can be useful to split CSS into multiple stylesheets, to avoid creating a mess in the master stylesheet. Additional stylesheets are loaded through `@import` directives. By default, the project's master stylesheet contains a single import of `<theme-name>.css` file that can be used to define your styles and other imports.
