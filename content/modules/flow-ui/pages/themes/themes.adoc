== Applying a Theme

The application theme is applied using the `@Theme` annotation with the name of the theme folder as a parameter. The `@Theme` annotation must be placed on the class that implements the `AppShellConfigurator` interface, which is usually the main application class.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Theme(value = "my-theme")
public class MyProjectApplication implements AppShellConfigurator {
    ...
}
----

A theme variant can be specified as an additional parameter, such as *dark* or *light*.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Theme(value = "my-theme", variant = "dark")
public class MyProjectApplication implements AppShellConfigurator {
    ...
}
----

NOTE: Themes cannot be switched at runtime. Although a project may have multiple themes, only one can be applied for the UI. However, there are ways to https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/styling/advanced/runtime-theme-switching[switch between variants^] of the same theme and https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/styling/advanced/loading-styles-dynamically[load dynamically additional styles^] on top of a theme.

[[application-theme]]
== Application Theme

For use in an application, the theme folder is placed inside the `frontend/themes` folder, with a name of your choosing. Jmix application projects created using Studio have a predefined theme folder with the same name as the project itself.

.Theme folder file structure
image::themes/theme-folder-structure.png[align="center", width="285"]

* `my-project` - the theme folder, also used as theme name
* `styles.css` - the master stylesheet
* `my-project.css` - an entry point for custom styles and imports
* `theme.json` - a theme configuration file, which by default defines *jmix-lumo* as the default theme.

`styles.css` is the entry point to the theme's styles. All CSS, including *Lumo* style property values and custom component styles, can be added there.

It can be useful to split CSS into multiple files to avoid cluttering the main stylesheet. Additional CSS files are loaded using `@import` directives. By default, the project's master stylesheet contains a single import of `<theme-name>.css` file that defines your styles and any other imports.

[source,css,indent=0]
.styles.css
----
@import url('./my-project.css');
----

== Reusable Theme

An application theme can be used in multiple applications by packaging it as a JAR dependency.

The theme add-on project's file structure looks as follows:

.Theme add-on file structure
image::themes/theme-addon-structure.png[align="center", width="296"]

* `cobalt` - the theme folder, also used as theme name
* `styles.css` - the master stylesheet
* `theme.json` - a theme configuration file. It's recommended to define *jmix-lumo* as the parent theme, so your custom theme includes *jmix-lumo* styles required for proper work of Jmix UI components and views.

After theme add-on is added as a dependency to the project, the packaged theme can be used as a standalone theme:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Theme(value = "cobalt")
public class MyProjectApplication implements AppShellConfigurator {
    ...
}
----

or as a parent for the project's themes, for example:

[source,json,indent=0]
.theme.json
----
{
  "parent": "cobalt",
  "lumoImports":["typography","color","spacing","badge","utility"]
}
----

In this case, the project's theme will load on top of the base theme, extending it.


[[pluggable-styles]]
== Pluggable Styles

An xref:ROOT:add-ons.adoc[add-on] may contain a file with custom styles in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/` directory. To add these styles to the resulting application, define the `jmix.ui.export-styles` property in the `module.properties` file. The value of this property is a path relative to `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/`, for example, `jmix.ui.export-styles = addon-styles/my-addon-styles.css`.

Custom styles are added as `<style type="text/css">` to the `<head>` element, for example:

[source,html,indent=0]
----
<style type="text/css">
.test {
    color: red;
}
</style>
----

IMPORTANT: Consider this approach only for a small number of styles that cannot be converted into a reusable theme or applied to a particular component.
