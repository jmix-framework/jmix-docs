= Pluggable Styles

An Add-on may contain a file with custom styles under `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/` directory. In order to add these styles to the resulting app the `jmix.ui.export-styles` property must be added to the `module.properties` file. The value of the property is a relative path from `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/`, e.g. `jmix.ui.export-styles = addon-styles/my-addon-styles.css`.

Custom styles are added as `<style type="text/css">` to the `<head>` element, e.g.:

[source,html,indent=0]
----
<style type="text/css">
.test {
    color: red;
}
</style>
----

NOTE: Consider this approach only for a small amount of styles that cannot be converted to a reusable theme or applied to a particular component.
