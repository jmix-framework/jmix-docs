= Pluggable Styles

An add-on may contain a file with custom styles in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/` directory. To add these styles to the resulting application, define the `jmix.ui.export-styles` property in the `module.properties` file. The value of this property is a path relative to `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/`, for example, `jmix.ui.export-styles = addon-styles/my-addon-styles.css`.

Custom styles are added as `<style type="text/css">` to the `<head>` element, for example:

[source,html,indent=0]
----
<style type="text/css">
.test {
    color: red;
}
</style>
----

NOTE: Consider this approach only for a small number of styles that cannot be converted into a reusable theme or applied to a particular component.
