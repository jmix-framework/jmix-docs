= Exception Handlers
:page-aliases: exception-handlers.adoc

Unhandled exceptions thrown in the HTTP request thread are passed to the Jmix exception handling mechanism. It contains a list of handlers, each of which is capable of handling the exception or choosing not to. If the exception is hot handled by any specific handler, it is passed to `DefaultUiExceptionHandler` which shows a dialog with the exception message and the stack trace. You can customize the dialog as explained <<customizing-default-handler,below>>.

[[application-exception-handlers]]
== Application Exception Handlers

You can provide own handlers for any exceptions. The simplest way to do it is to create a subclass of `AbstractUiExceptionHandler` and register it as a Spring bean.

For example, if you have the following exception:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/exception/MyException.java[]
----

You can define a handler for it as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/exception/MyExceptionHandler.java[]
----
<1> - Make the handler a Spring bean.
<2> - Extend `AbstractUiExceptionHandler`.
<3> - Inject any other Spring beans if needed.
<4> - Pass the fully-qualified class name of the exception to the super constructor.
<5> - Handle the exception in `doHandle()` method.

Your exception handler will be automatically added to the list of handlers by the framework. You can adjust the position of your handler in the list by adding the `@Order` annotation to your bean. For example, if you set the order as `@Order(JmixOrder.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE - 10)`, your handler will have a priority over a framework's handler for the same exception.

If you need more control over determining what exceptions should be processed by your handler, either override the `canHandle()` method of the `AbstractUiExceptionHandler` base class, or don't use `AbstractUiExceptionHandler` at all and implement the `UiExceptionHandler` interface directly. See also https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/advanced/custom-error-handler[Vaadin documentation^] for how to handle UI exceptions on the lower level.

[[unique-constraint-violation-handler]]
== Unique Constraint Violation Handler

Jmix provides a built-in handler for database unique constraint violation errors: `UniqueConstraintViolationHandler`. It can be easily customized in two aspects.

First, you can modify the message that is shown to the user in response to the error. The message is set in the message bundle with the key in the `databaseUniqueConstraintViolation.<DB_CONSTRAINT_NAME>` format, for example:

[source, properties]
.messages_en.properties
----
databaseUniqueConstraintViolation.IDX_DEPARTMENT_UNQ_NAME=A department with the same name already exists
----

Second, you can provide your own pattern for recognizing unique constraint violations. The framework contains default patterns for each database type, for example for PostgreSQL it is `ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "(.+)"`. You can see the default patterns in the implementations of the `DbmsFeatures` interface. If a default pattern doesn't work for you (it may happen because of a database localization), provide your pattern in the xref:data-access:data-properties.adoc#jmix.data.unique-constraint-violation-pattern[jmix.data.unique-constraint-violation-pattern] property.

[[customizing-default-handler]]
== Customizing Default Handler

You can customize the dialog shown by the default exception handler. The example below explains how to add a button that allows users to report the exception to a system administrator.

First, create your dialog class based on `ExceptionDialog` and override appropriate methods:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/exception/MyExceptionDialog.java[]
----
<1> - Register the class as a prototype bean.
<2> - Extend `ExceptionDialog`.
<3> - Override appropriate methods to customize the standard dialog.

Then create a provider class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/exception/MyExceptionDialogProvider.java[]
----
<1> - Use `ObjectProvider` because `MyExceptionDialog` is a prototype bean.
<2> - You can instruct the provider to take effect only for specific exceptions. Return `true` if you want it to work for all exception types.
<3> - Return new instance of `MyExceptionDialog`.

The framework will pick up your provider and use the returned dialog for unhandled exceptions.

[[navigation-exception-handling]]
== Navigation Exception Handling

If an unhandled exception occurs during navigation, Vaadin displays a special error view. For example, when a user navigates to a non-existent route, the following page is shown (in a production build it doesn't show available routes):

.Example of default route not found error page
image::exception-handlers/original-error-page.png[align="center", width="821"]

The `RouteNotFoundError` for `com.vaadin.flow.router.NotFoundException`, and `RouteAccessDeniedError` for `com.vaadin.flow.router.AccessDeniedException` are implemented by default.

If you want to provide a custom error page, create a class extending the default one, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/exception/CustomRouteNotFoundError.java[]
----

.Example of custom route not found error page
image::exception-handlers/custom-error-page.png[align="center", width="821"]

Your class will be automatically picked up by the framework and used for displaying routing errors.

See also {vaadin-docs}/flow/routing/exceptions[Vaadin documentation^] for more information about navigation exceptions.
