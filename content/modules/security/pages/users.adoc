= Users

[[entity]]
== User Entity

Users of a Jmix application are defined by the `User` class that is automatically generated by xref:studio:project.adoc#creating-new-project[Studio] in a new project. It is a xref:data-model:entities.adoc#jpa[JPA entity] implementing the `JmixUserDetails` interface which has a number of methods required by the framework:

* `getUsername()` returns a unique user name.
* `getPassword()` returns a hashed password.
* `isEnabled()`, `isAccountNonExpired()`, `isAccountNonLocked()`, `isCredentialsNonExpired()` indicate whether the user can log in to the system.
* `getAuthorities()`, `setAuthorities()` are used by the framework to associate the user with a set of permissions upon login.

Users are stored in the main database of your application. By default, the `User` entity and the corresponding database table have the following attributes:

* `id`, `version` are the standard primary key and optimistic locking attributes.
* `username`, `password`, `enabled` store values returned by the methods of the `JmixUserDetails` interface.
* `email`, `firstName`, `lastName` store additional information about users.

You can define any number of additional attributes required for your application, for example, `department` or `position`.

[[management]]
== User Management

A new project contains the `010-init-user.xml` xref:data-model:db-migration.adoc#changelogs[database migration] script that creates a user with the `admin`/`admin` username/password and grants the user full access to the application by associating the entity with the `system-full-access` xref:resource-roles.adoc[role].

A new project also contains the UI views for managing users, see *Application* -> *Users*. These views allow you to create, edit and remove users, change and reset their passwords. To assign roles to a user, click the *Role assignments* button in the user list view.

TIP: The framework provides the `ui-minimal` role that gives permissions to log in to UI and use some common UI elements. Assign this role to new users that will interact with the application through the UI, otherwise they won't be able to log in.

[[built-in]]
== Built-in Users

Any Jmix application with the standard security subsystem has two built-in user objects:

* _Anonymous_ user object corresponds to not authenticated users. It allows you to grant some permissions to users before they log in.

* _System_ user object is required for the xref:authentication.adoc#system[system authentication] mechanism. It is used when there is no real user interacting with the application, for example, when the application is starting up, or when a business method is called by a scheduler.

The built-in user objects are not stored in the database but created on the application startup by the `DatabaseUserRepository` class of your project. You can customize both users in the `initAnonymousUser()` and `initSystemUser()` methods of this class. By default, the system user is associated with the `system-full-access` role and hence has all permissions.

The anonymous user has no permissions by default.

// You can find an example of how to grant permissions to anonymous users in the xref:ui:anonymous-access-to-screens.adoc[Anonymous Access to Screens] section.

[[user-substitution]]
== User Substitution

The system administrator can give a user an ability to substitute another user. The substitution means the user has the xref:security:resource-roles.adoc[resource] and xref:security:row-level-roles.adoc[row-level] roles of the substituted user. For example, if Alice substitutes Bob, she logs in to the application as Alice but has the Bob's roles.

To see the feature in action, do the following:

. Log in as `admin` and create at least one more user with the `UI: minimal access` role.
. Select `admin` in the *Users* table and click *Additional -> User substitution*. You will see a list of users that `admin` can substitute.
. Create a new record with the user who `admin` should be able to substitute, then click *OK* in the list view..
. Now you will see that the current user name in the `userIndicator` component of the main view has changed to a dropdown list that contains the substituted user. If you select this user, the workspace will change as if you re-login as this user. But all audit features will still register `admin` - the logged-in user.

The `CurrentUserSubstitution` bean can be used to obtain a currently substituted user, an authenticated user, or the effective user (which is substituted user in case of substitution, authenticated one otherwise).

For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/security-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/main/MainView.java[tags=user-substitution]
----

* The `CurrentAuthentication.getUser()` method always returns the authenticated user.

* The `CurrentAuthentication.getAuthentication().getAuthorities()` returns authorities of the effective user. That is, in the case of substitution, these authorities differ from the authorities of the authenticated user.
