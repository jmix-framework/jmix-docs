[[system]]
== Check System Requirements

Make sure your computer meets the following requirements:

* 64-bit operating system: Windows, Linux or macOS.

* Memory – at least 8 GB (16 GB is recommended).

* Hard drive free space – at least 20 GB.

[[studio]]
== Install Jmix Studio

*Jmix Studio* is implemented as a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. The minimal supported IntelliJ IDEA version is {minimal-idea-version}.

If you don't have IntelliJ IDEA installed yet, download *Community* edition from the {idea-download-site}[JetBrains website^] and install it.

After IntelliJ IDEA has been installed, do the following:

. Start IntelliJ IDEA ({minimal-idea-version} or newer).
. On the startup screen of the IDE click the *Plugins* button. 
+
If you have any project opened, use the main menu: *File* -> *Settings* (on Windows and Linux) or *IntelliJ IDEA* -> *Preferences* (on macOS). Then switch to the *Plugins* section.
. Switch to the *Marketplace* tab.
. Enter "jmix" into the search field. You will see the Jmix plugin in the search results.
. Click *Install* and follow the further instructions of the IDE.

In case you need to configure internet access via a proxy server or install non-standard Studio builds, visit the xref:studio:install.adoc#installation[Studio installation] section. 

NOTE: To have access to the premium Studio features, configure subscription in the xref:studio:subscription.adoc[subscription] dialog window.

[[jdk]]
== Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

//TIP: This step is optional because the JDK can be quickly downloaded when creating a new project in Jmix Studio, see xref:studio:project.adoc#creating-new-project[Creating New Project].

Download JDK version 17 (for example, https://adoptium.net[Eclipse Temurin^] or https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads[Liberica^] JDK) and install it to a directory suggested by the installer. This is enough for creating and running applications from the IDE.

NOTE: With Jmix {page-component-display-version}, you can build applications using Java 17 from any vendor. However, we don't recommend an OpenJ9-based JDK due to the problems it has caused in the past.

To run Jmix applications from the terminal, set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable as described below.

* On *Windows*, create the `JAVA_HOME` variable with the path to the installed JDK root directory at *Computer* -> *Properties* -> *Advanced System Settings* -> *Advanced* -> *Environment variables*. The variable should be added to the *System variables* list.

* On *macOS* and *Linux* set `JAVA_HOME` in `~/.bash_profile` or another appropriate file of your shell, for example:
+
[source,bash]
----
export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/liberica-jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home"
----

* Restart the computer to make sure the environment variable has taken effect.

* Check correctness of the environment variable by running the following command in the console:
+
--

.On Windows
[source,bash]
----
"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java" -version
----

.On Linux and macOS
[source,bash]
----
"$JAVA_HOME/bin/java" -version
----

The command should return the Java version, e.g. `17.0.3`.
--

CAUTION: If you connect to the internet via a proxy server, some Java system properties must be passed to the JVM running development tools and Gradle. xref:studio:install.adoc#working-behind-proxy[Configure] these properties using Jmix Studio.

[[Troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

Depending on the size of your project, you may need to increase available memory for the IntelliJ IDEA and Gradle processes.

. In IntelliJ IDEA, open *Help -> Edit Custom VM Options...* and edit the `-Xmx` parameter (it's usually on top). The recommended value is `2048m` or more, for example:
+
[source,text]
----
-Xmx2048m
----

. Edit the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file and set the `-Xmx` parameter in the `org.gradle.jvmargs` property. The recommended value is `2048m` or more, for example:
+
[source,properties]
----
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m
----
