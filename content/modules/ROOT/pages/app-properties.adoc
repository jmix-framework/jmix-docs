For example:

[source,properties]
----
jmix.core.available-locales = en,de
----

[[jmix.core.conf-dir]]
=== jmix.core.conf-dir

Indicates the directory for configuration files that can be changed at runtime. Used by the default implementation of the `Resources` interface to load resource files from the directory before searching in the classpath.

Default value: `${user.dir}/.jmix/conf`

TIP: `${user.dir}` is the user working directory (where JVM was started).

[[jmix.core.cross-data-store-reference-loading-batch-size]]
=== jmix.core.cross-data-store-reference-loading-batch-size

Defines the batch size when loading xref:data-model:entities.adoc[cross-datastore references] for a collection of entities.

Default value: `50`


[[jmix.core.default-file-storage]]
=== jmix.core.default-file-storage

Specifies a default file storage if xref:files:file-storage.adoc#multiple-fs[multiple file storages] are used in the application.

[[jmix.core.exclude-beans]]
=== jmix.core.exclude-beans

A comma-separated list of bean names to exclude from the Spring application context. It can be used to xref:modularity:extension.adoc#beans[override beans] already having `@Primary` annotations in some add-on.

For example:

[source,properties]
----
jmix.core.exclude-beans = abc_FooService,abc_BarService
----

[[jmix.core.fetch-plans-config]]
=== jmix.core.fetch-plans-config

For example:
[source,properties]
----
jmix.core.fetch-plans-config = com/company/demo/fetch-plans.xml
----

[[jmix.core.temp-dir]]
=== jmix.core.temp-dir

Defines the directory where the application can store temporary files.

Used by the framework and add-ons for operations like export/import and upload/download.

Default value: `${user.dir}/.jmix/temp`

TIP: `${user.dir}` is the user working directory (where JVM was started).

[[jmix.core.trigger-files-enabled]]
=== jmix.core.trigger-files-enabled

Enables processing of bean invocation trigger files.

The trigger file is a file that is placed in the `triggers` subdirectory of the application's <<jmix.core.temp-dir,temporary directory>>. The file name consists of two parts separated with the `#` symbol: the first part is the bean class, the second part is the method name of the bean to invoke. For example: `io.jmix.core.Messages#clearCache`. The trigger files handler monitors the folder for new trigger files, invokes the appropriate methods and then removes the files.

Default value: `true`

[[jmix.core.trigger-files-process-interval]]
=== jmix.core.trigger-files-process-interval

Period of <<jmix.core.trigger-files-enabled,trigger files>> searching and processing in milliseconds.

Default value: `5000`

[[jmix.core.web-host-name]]
=== jmix.core.web-host-name

Indicates the name of the host on which the application is running.

This property can be used by various application subsystems. If the property is needed for a subsystem, it should be mentioned in its documentation.

NOTE: This property doesn't affect actual server address on which the application is running. To bind to a specific address, use `server.address` Spring Boot property.

[[jmix.core.web-port]]
=== jmix.core.web-port

Indicates the port on which the application is running.

This property can be used by various application subsystems. If the property is needed for a subsystem, it should be mentioned in its documentation.

NOTE: This property doesn't affect actual server port on which the application is running. To bind to a specific port, use `server.port` Spring Boot property.

[[jmix.core.work-dir]]
=== jmix.core.work-dir

Defines the work directory where the application can store some data.

Used by the xref:files:file-storage.adoc#local-fs[Local File Storage] which by default creates the file storage structure in its `filestorage` subdirectory.

TIP: `${user.dir}` is the user working directory (where JVM was started).

[[cors]]
