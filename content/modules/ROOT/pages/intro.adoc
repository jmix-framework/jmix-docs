[[whats-jmix]]
== What is Jmix?

*Jmix* is a high-level full-stack framework for enterprise web applications. It comes with advanced tooling and a rich set of functional modules.

Jmix is intended for fast development of web applications with a large data model and complex UI aimed at internal users of an organization. There are various types of applications in this category, including just CRUD, an admin UI for a website, a business automation tool, a CRM or an ERP-class system. Anything that involves working with tens or hundreds of interconnected entities in hundreds or thousands of screens, while using mostly standard UI components like fields, forms and tables.

Jmix is based on Spring Boot, which is a de-facto standard for creating enterprise Java web applications. It means that you can use a lot of third-party libraries and frameworks with minimal configuration, in addition to the functionality provided by Jmix.

// todo Open-source, apps are owned by developers

*Jmix Studio* is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that helps you at all stages of the application development: creating and configuring a project, defining data model, generating database migration scripts, developing UI views in a visual editor. It provides advanced navigation, code completion and inspections specific to Jmix projects.
