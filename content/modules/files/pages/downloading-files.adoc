= Downloading and Displaying Files

This section explains how to download files to the user's computer or display files in UI. For information on how to get files from the server through REST API, see the xref:rest:files-api.adoc[Files API] section.

[[downloader]]
== Using Downloader

The `Downloader` bean is designed to download files to the user's computer. It has a number of `download()` methods that accept different parameters defining downloaded content.

The file can be either downloaded or shown by the browser in a new tab. It depends on the file type and the value of the xref:ui:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.view-file-extensions[jmix.ui.view-file-extensions] property. The file type is determined by the `DownloadFormat` parameter, or, if it is not provided, by the file name extension. You can also force showing the content instead of downloading it regardless of the type by invoking the `setShowNewWindow(true)` method of `Downloader`.

[[download-from-storage]]
=== Downloading from File Storage

The `download()` method with the `FileRef` value allows you to download file from the file storage. The `FileRef` object contains all necessary information about the file, so you can just pass it alone to `Downloader`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/files/ex1/screen/attachment/AttachmentEdit.java[tags=downloader;download-from-fs]
----

[[download-arbitrary]]
=== Downloading Arbitrary Resources

The `download()` method can accept byte arrays, which allows you to download files or any other content. You should pass the byte array itself, the target file name and an optional format, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/files/ex1/screen/attachment/AttachmentEdit.java[tags=downloader;download-array]
----

To use a format not present in the `DownloadFormat` constants, create a new instance of `DownloadFormat` and pass it to the `download()` method, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/files/ex1/screen/attachment/AttachmentEdit.java[tags=downloader;download-format]
----

The `download()` method can also accept a lambda which returns an `InputStream` to download the content of this stream. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/files/ex1/screen/attachment/AttachmentEdit.java[tags=downloader;data-provider]
----

[[display-files]]
== Displaying Files in UI Screens

Jmix provides two UI components for embedding content into UI screens:

* xref:ui:vcl/components/image.adoc[] allows you to display images from various resources using the HTML `<img>` element. The component can be declaratively bound to an entity attribute to display images stored as byte arrays in the database or as files in the file storage.

* xref:ui:vcl/components/browser-frame.adoc[] allows you to embed content inside the HTML `<iframe>` element.

See the components documentation for detailed information and examples.
