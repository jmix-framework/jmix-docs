= Introduction


The *BPM add-on* integrates the open-source xref:bpm:introduction.adoc#flowable-bpm[Flowable BPM engine] into *Jmix Platform*, bringing to it new tools to design, manage, and automate various complex interactions between people and systems.

[[architecture]]
== Architecture Overview

*BPM add-on* includes components available in *Studio* and in the *web application* at runtime.
In Studio, the developer has a xref:bpm:modeler-studio.adoc[*Modeler*] for creating BPMN process models, a *Process Form Wizard* (in View Creation Wizard), and a BPM section in the *Jmix Tool Window*.

In the web application, you receive the process xref:bpm:process-modeling.adoc#process-modeling-web[*Modeler*] almost the same as in Studio by functionality, a set of administrative views, and views for regular users allowing they to start processes and work with their tasks.


Besides, some extensions become available when you model the process:

* xref:bpm:bpmn/jmix-entity-data-task.adoc[*Entity Data Task*] -- allows to create, modify, and load Jmix Entities directly from the BPMN model.
* xref:bpm:bpmn/jmix-email-task.adoc[*Email Sending Task*] -- allows to send emails from within the BPMN model.
* xref:bpm:bpmn/bpmn-user-task.adoc#assign-task-by-user-provider[*User Providers*] -- interfaces allowing to define task performers and candidates programmatically.
* xref:bpm:listeners.adoc#spring-events-bpm[*Jmix BPM Spring Events*] -- simplify implementation of listeners.
* ... and a number of other improvements.

As well, the BPM add-on creates required tables in the database.

[[bpmn-20]]
== BPMN 2.0

Jmix BPM uses BPMN 2.0 that is a widely accepted and supported standard for modeling and executing automated business processes.

[quote, Object Management Group]
The Business Process Modeling Notation is a graphical notation that depicts the steps in a business process.
BPMN depicts the end-to-end flow of a business process.
The notation has been specifically designed to coordinate the sequence of processes and the messages that flow between different process participants in a related set of activities.

You can find the official version of BPMN specification at the OMG website:
https://www.omg.org/bpmn/


[[flowable-bpm]]
== Flowable BPM Engine

https://flowable.com/open-source/[Flowable] is an open-source Business Process Management (BPM) engine that provides a lightweight, efficient, and highly customizable solution for automating business processes. It is written in Java and supports the BPMN 2.0, CMMN, and DMN standards for modeling and executing processes.

[NOTE]
====
Jmix BPM doesn't support case management using CMMN.
====

Flowable is a fork of *Activiti* (registered trademark of Alfresco). In all the following sections, you’ll notice that the package names, configuration files, and so on, use flowable.

[[databas-configuration]]
== Database Configuration

During the installation process, *Jmix* creates required database tables in the xref:data-model:data-stores.adoc#main[Main Data Store].


[[database-table-names]]
== DB Table Names

The database names of Flowable all start with `ACT_`  (that refers to *Activiti* name). The second part is a two-character identification of the use case. This use case will also roughly match the service API.

*ACT_RE_*: `RE` stands for repository. Tables with this prefix contain 'static' information such as process definitions and process resources (images, rules, etc.)

*ACT_RU_*: `RU` stands for runtime. These are the runtime tables that contain the runtime data of process instances, user tasks, variables, jobs, and so on. Flowable only stores the runtime data during process instance execution and removes the records when a process instance ends. This keeps the runtime tables small and fast.

*ACT_HI_*: `HI` stands for history. These are the tables that contain historic data, such as past process instances, variables, tasks, and so on.

*ACT_GE_*: `GE` means general data, which is used for various use cases.


[[bpm-roles]]
== BPM Roles

During the installation process, the system creates two distinct roles:

* *BPM: administrator* - for administrative tasks.
* *BPM: process actor* - for participation in processes.

To grant users access to all BPM administrative views, assign them the *BPM: administrator* role. If users only need to participate in processes, assign them the *BPM: process actor* role.


[[additionally]]
== Additionally

Alongside the BPM features, incorporating other *add-ons* can further enhance your application's capabilities:

* xref:jmix:quartz:index.adoc[Quartz] – allows scheduled tasks execution, configurable at runtime.
* xref:jmix:business-calendar:index.adoc[Business calendar] – enables accounting for working hours, which is especially useful in business processes.
* xref:jmix:notifications:index.adoc[Notifications] – allows sending notifications to process participants and supervisory personnel. See xref:bpm:sending-notifications.adoc[] section for details.
* xref:jmix:email:index.adoc[Email Sending] -- allows to send email messages, it is required when using xref:bpm:bpmn/jmix-email-task.adoc[Email Sending task].
* xref:jmix:reports:index.adoc[Reports] – enables building reports based on operational data and process execution statistics.
