From the editor, you can suspend the process definition. In this case, the process will not be available for starting until you activate it. In the suspend process definition dialog, you have an option to suspend running process instances as well. In this case, user tasks of suspended instances won’t be displayed in the tasks list, all timers and jobs won’t be executed.
