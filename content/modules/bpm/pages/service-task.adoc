= Service Task

#@Deprecated#

Flowable engine gives you the following ways to declare how Java logic should be invoked for the service task:

* Specifying a class that implements `JavaDelegate` or `ActivityBehavior`.
* Evaluating an expression that resolves to a delegation object.
* Invoking a method expression.

See https://flowable.com/open-source/docs/bpmn/ch07b-BPMN-Constructs/#java-service-task[Flowable documentation^] for details.

[[spring-bean-service-task]]
== Spring Bean Service Task

BPM add-on adds one more way to define a service task. It allows you to select a Spring bean, the bean method and provide parameter values for the selected method. Bean name and methods are selected from drop-down lists. After the method is selected, a panel for entering method argument values is displayed.

The panel for the Spring bean helps to build an expression for bean method invocation. In case of method from the screenshot above, the expression will be:

`${smpl_OrderStatusBean.setStatus(order, 'Sent')}`

Pay attention to the *is var* check box. It makes sense mostly for string parameters. If the check box is not selected, then the argument value will be written to the resulting expression in apostrophes. If the check box is selected, no apostrophes will be added and a variable with a provided name will be passed to the method.

* `${smpl_MyBean.someMethod('description')}` – this expression will use the string value `description`.
* `${smpl_MyBean.someMethod(description)}` – this expression will use the value of the variable named `description`.

[[java-delegate-service-task]]
== Java Delegate Service Task

If you select `JavaDelegate class` in the *Type* combo box, then the list of classes that implement the `org.flowable.engine.delegate.JavaDelegate` interface will appear. See https://flowable.com/open-source/docs/bpmn/ch07b-BPMN-Constructs/#implementation[Flowable documentation^] for more details.

If the selected JavaDelegate class contains fields of `org.flowable.common.engine.api.delegate.Expression` type (see https://flowable.com/open-source/docs/bpmn/ch07b-BPMN-Constructs/#field-injection[Field Injection^] in Flowable documentation), then field names will appear in the *Fields* table.

In case you want to use Spring context in the `JavaDelegate` implementation, add `@Component` annotation and select `Delegate expression` in the modeler.

If you use Flowable field injection in `JavaDelegate` with Spring context, then this bean scope must be `prototype` - you need to add the `@Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)` annotation. See https://flowable.com/open-source/docs/bpmn/ch07b-BPMN-Constructs/#field-injection-and-thread-safety[Flowable documentation^] for details.

Here is an example of Java class that sends an email:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/bpm/ex1/service/SendEmailJavaDelegate.java[tags=java-delegate]
----
<1> We declare three fields. Values of the fields are defined in the process model.
<2> The `execute` method is invoked when the process reaches the service task.
<3> Evaluate the value of the expression.
<4> Creates `EmailInfo` object.
<5> Sends xref:email:index.adoc[email] asynchronously.

The properties panel for the service task looks this way:

You can specify fields in the editor:

In the example above, we select the `expression` field type for the `addressee` field. In our case, the `manager` process variable contains a user.
