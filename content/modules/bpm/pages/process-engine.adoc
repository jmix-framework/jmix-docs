= Process Engine

The Flowable *Process Engine* is a core component responsible for managing and executing business processes defined in BPMN.
It provides the necessary infrastructure to deploy, start, and control process instances, ensuring that business workflows are executed according to defined rules and logic.

The Process Engine exposes various services, each serving specific functionalities:

* **RepositoryService**: Responsible for deploying and managing BPMN process definitions.
* **RuntimeService**: Manages the execution of process instances and handles their state transitions.
* **TaskService**: Manages user tasks, allowing for task creation, assignment, and querying.
* **IdentityService**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
* **ManagementService**: Provides administrative functions for managing the engine and its resources.
* **HistoryService**: Manages historical data related to completed process instances.
* **DynamicBpmnService**: Enables dynamic modifications to BPMN models at runtime.
* **FormService**: Facilitates form handling within processes. (Not used in Jmix BPM.)
