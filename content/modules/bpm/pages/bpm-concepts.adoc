= BPM Concepts

In the following section,
we will explore key concepts essential to understanding the Jmix BPM with the embedded Flowable Process Engine.
These concepts include process models, process definitions, executions, process instances, deployments, tokens, and the process context.
Each of these elements plays a vital role in how the engine operates, facilitating the execution and management of business processes.


[[process-engine]]
== Process Engine

The Flowable *Process Engine* is a core component responsible for managing and executing business processes defined in BPMN.
It provides the necessary infrastructure to deploy, start, and control process instances, ensuring that business workflows are executed according to defined rules and logic.

The Process Engine exposes various services, each serving specific functionalities:

* **RepositoryService**: Responsible for deploying and managing BPMN process definitions.
* **RuntimeService**: Manages the execution of process instances and handles their state transitions.
* **TaskService**: Manages user tasks, allowing for task creation, assignment, and querying.
* **IdentityService**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
* **ManagementService**: Provides administrative functions for managing the engine and its resources.
* **HistoryService**: Manages historical data related to completed process instances.
* **DynamicBpmnService**: Enables dynamic modifications to BPMN models at runtime.
* **FormService**: Facilitates form handling within processes. (Not used in Jmix BPM.)

=== Configuration

[[job-executor]]
== Job Executor

The Flowable *Job Executor* is a key component responsible for managing and executing asynchronous jobs within the Flowable process engine.
It handles tasks such as timers, asynchronous continuations, and other background processes that need to be executed outside the main process flow.
By offloading these tasks, the job executor ensures that the main execution thread remains responsive and efficient.

The job executor operates in a multithreaded environment, allowing it to process multiple jobs concurrently.
It retrieves jobs from the database, executes them, and updates their status accordingly.
This mechanism is essential for implementing features like delayed tasks and scheduled events in business processes.

Overall, the Flowable Job Executor enhances the performance and scalability of the process engine by efficiently managing background jobs and ensuring smooth process execution.
