= Process Modeling and Execution

This section covers the key concepts and workflow related to process modeling and execution in Jmix BPM.

== Suspending and Activation

In Flowable, *suspending* a process definition prevents new instances from starting, while *activating* it allows new instances to begin. This provides control over process execution. You can suspend a certain version of the process definition or all its versions at once.

Similarly, *suspending* a process instance pauses its execution until it is *activated* again. This is useful when certain conditions must be met before proceeding or when an instance needs to be temporarily halted.

Suspending and activating process definitions and instances enables flexible management of business processes in Flowable. It allows temporary halts and controlled resumption based on operational needs, ensuring process integrity and adaptability to changing circumstances.

To suspend and activate process definitions, use *BPM* -> xref:bpm:menu-views/process-definitions.adoc[Process definitions view].

To suspend and activate process instances, use *BPM* -> xref:bpm:menu-views/process-instances.adoc[Process instances view].

== Process Development Workflow


In Flowable, when you want to deploy your model to the engine, the process typically involves two main steps:

*Create a Deployment*: You first create a deployment object. This is where you package your process definitions (and any associated resources) for deployment to the Flowable engine. This step makes the process definitions available for execution.

*Process Definition Creation*: Once the deployment is successful, it creates one or more process definitions based on the BPMN models you provided. These process definitions are the executable versions of your business processes, which can then be instantiated and executed.
In summary, the deployment acts as a container for your process definitions, and upon deployment, the engine recognizes these definitions and prepares them for execution.
