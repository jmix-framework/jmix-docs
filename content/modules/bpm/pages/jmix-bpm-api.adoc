= BPM API


Jmix BPM uses the <<flowable-api,Flowable API>>, allowing seamless interaction with the xref:bpm:bpm-concepts.adoc#process-engine[process engine] within a Spring Boot environment. This simplifies development and enhances the user experience by offering a cohesive BPM framework.

Additionally, Flowable's standalone <<flowable-rest-api,REST API>> enables external systems to interact with the process engine, promoting interoperability and integration into broader application architectures. Understanding the available APIs and extensions empowers developers to harness the full potential of Flowable within the Jmix BPM ecosystem.

[[flowable-api]]
== Flowable API

You can use Flowable API to interact with the process engine. This API allows you to start process instances programmatically, complete tasks, and execute various queries, for example, get a list of tasks for a user or get active instances of a process definition.

[NOTE]
====
Flowable `FormService` and `IdentityService` are not used in Jmix BPM projects.
====

Flowable services can be obtained in two ways:

* Using `ProcessEngines` as a starting point:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/bpm/ex1/screen/customer/CustomerEdit.java[tags=services]
----
+
* Injecting services inside your beans as they are registered as Spring beans:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/bpm/ex1/service/MyCustomBean.java[tags=bean;runtime-service]
----

== Jmix BPM API Extension

The *Jmix BPM add-on* provides `BpmTaskService` that extends `TaskService` of Flowable. See an example of the usage <<using-bpm-task-service,below>>.

[[examples]]
== Examples

[[starting-process-programmatically]]
=== Starting Process Programmatically

In the example below, the process is started programmatically from the regular entity editor using `RuntimeService`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/bpm/ex1/screen/customer/CustomerEdit.java[tags=runtime-service;commit]
----
<1> Puts the edited entity to the process variable with the `customer` name.
<2> The customer's name is put to the process variable with a String type.
<3> `RuntimeService` is used to start the process.
<4> `new-customer` is the process definition key.
<5> Puts the process variables map.

[[getting-list-of-user-tasks]]
=== Getting a List of User Tasks

Let's look at the examples that show getting a list of active tasks assigned to the authenticated user:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/bpm/ex1/service/MyCustomBean.java[tags=task-service;current-authentication;get-tasks]
----
<1> Uses `TaskService` to get a list of tasks.
<2> Searches for the tasks of the `approval` process.
<3> Searches for the tasks assigned to the current user.

[[getting-list-of-process-instances]]
=== Getting List of Process Instances

The example below shows getting a list of process instances of the `approval` definition related to the specified `Order` entity:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/bpm/ex1/service/MyCustomBean.java[tags=runtime-service;get-instances]
----
<1> Uses `RuntimeService` to get a list of tasks.
<2> Searches for the instances of the `approval` process.
<3> Searches for the process instances with the specified `orderId` process variable.

[[using-bpm-task-service]]
=== Using BpmTaskService

`BpmTaskService` extends the `TaskService` and adds a method for completing tasks with an outcome:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
void completeTaskWithOutcome(String taskId, String outcomeId, Map<String, Object> processVariables);
----

You can inject the service into your Spring component:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/bpm/ex1/screen/customer/CustomerEdit.java[tags=inject-service]
----

or use the `ProcessEngines` class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/bpm/ex1/screen/customer/CustomerEdit.java[tags=get-service]
----




=== Working with Process Definitions via the API

Flowable provides a rich API for interacting with process definitions:

. *Deployment*: Process definitions are typically deployed as part of a deployment unit, which can include multiple definitions and related resources.
+
[source,java]
.filename.java
----
Deployment deployment = repositoryService.createDeployment()
                        .addClasspathResource("my-process.bpmn20.xml")
                        .deploy();
----

. *Querying*: The RepositoryService allows querying process definitions based on various criteria:
+
[source,java]
.filename.java
----
ProcessDefinition processDefinition = repositoryService.createProcessDefinitionQuery()
                                     .processDefinitionId("myProcessDefinitionId")
                                     .singleResult();
----

. *Suspension and Activation*: Process definitions can be suspended or activated, controlling whether new process instances can be started based on the definition:
+
[source,java]
.filename.java
----
repositoryService.suspendProcessDefinitionById("myProcessDefinitionId");
----

. *Diagram Generation*: Flowable can generate process diagram images for deployed process definitions:
+
[source,java]
.filename.java
----
InputStream diagramStream = repositoryService.getProcessDiagram(processDefinition.getId());
----

[[business-key]]
=== Setting and Updating a Business Key

//todo - BK in starting process

Business key can be updated programmatically via API:

[source,java]
----
runtimeService.updateBusinessKey("processInstanceId", "businessKey");
----
