= User Groups

In the *User groups* screen, you can manage groups of users to define them later as candidates for xref:bpm:user-task.adoc#task-candidate-users-and-groups[user task] assignees. A user can be a member of several groups. 

A group can have one of the following types:

* *Users*. For the group of *Users* type, users should be explicitly selected.
* *Roles*. For the group of *Roles* type, a set of security roles should be defined. Users are considered to be a member of the user group if they have one of the selected roles.
* *All users*. Group of this type automatically contains all users.
