The task has the following parameters:

* *To* - a recipient’s address. You can use a process variable or expression to provide the address, or specify it directly. Several addresses are possible and can be set in the editor:

* *Cc* - an additional address of a recipient, that receives the copy of the email. Conditions of setting addresses are the same as for the *To* field.
* *Bcc* is similar to the *Cc* field, but email addresses listed in the *Bcc* field are hidden from all recipients. Conditions of setting addresses are the same as for the *To* field.
* *From* - a sender’s address. You can use a process variable to provide the address.
* *Subject* - an email subject. You can use a process variable in the subject.
* *Content* - a body of the email. In the editor, you can select the type of the content: HTML or plain text. Using process variables is available.

* *Send asynchronously* - by default, emails are sent asynchronously. 
* *Attachments* - a file content. It should be specified as an expression: a process variable or a Spring bean method call. The `File`, `FileRef`, `byte[]`, and `FileDescription` types are supported.
+
Providing an attachment name is optional. If the name is not specified, it will be taken from the file content. In case of `byte[]` as a file content, the default `attachment_<incremental_part>` naming will be used.
