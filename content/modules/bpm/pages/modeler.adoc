== Pools and Lanes

Using pools and lanes element you can define assignees for all user tasks on the lane. Every user task on the lane without an explicitly defined assignee will inherit the assignee value from the lane.

To display the properties panel for the lane, select the lane on the canvas. In the example below, the `manager` process variable is assigned to the selected lane `Manager`.

== Model Drafts

When you click the *Deploy process* button (1) in the buttons panel, the process will be deployed to the Flowable engine and will be available for starting. If you don’t want it to be deployed and just want to save the process to get back to it later, use the *Save draft* (3) button. To open a draft, use the *Open draft* (2) button.
