= My Tasks

This view provides access to the active tasks of the currently authenticated user.
It organizes tasks in a tree structure, grouping them by their respective processes.

The task tree features two root nodes: *Assigned Tasks* and *Group Tasks*.
The *Assigned Tasks* node contains tasks where the user is the assignee,
while the *Group Tasks* node includes tasks where the user is a candidate.

The user navigates to a certain process and selects a task to open.
How to work with tasks, see in the xref:bpm:process-forms.adoc[Process Forms] section.

The *Due Date* shows when the task is expected to be completed.
However, this field is for informational purposes only.
If you want to monitor when tasks are overdue and perform any actions based on that, it should be done programmatically.

When designing your processes, use a xref:bpm:bpm-concepts.adoc#business-key[business key].
A business key makes the task list more informative, allowing users to understand which business object is associated with each process.

For example, see group tasks without the business key:

[TIP]
====
In most cases, the _entity instance name_ can serve as an effective business key.
