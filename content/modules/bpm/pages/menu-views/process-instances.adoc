The *Runtime* tab is available only for active process instances and contains information about the current process state: execution tree, variable values, active user tasks, and failed jobs.

Selecting items in the executions tree will modify the content of the *Variables* and *Tasks* tabs. If you select a particular execution, only objects related to this execution will be displayed.

Using the *Variables* tab, you can create, modify and remove process variables. Note that when an execution is selected in the tree, a new variable will be put to the selected execution.
