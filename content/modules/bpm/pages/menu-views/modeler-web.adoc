= BPMN Web Modeler

Jmix BPM enables you to create and modify process models in a web environment at runtime.
You can access the xref:bpm:menu-views/modeler-web.adoc[Modeler] through the *BPM* section in the main menu.

This feature allows you to:

- Fix minor issues in existing processes
- Make modifications during production work
- Create new processes from scratch

[IMPORTANT]
====
Those are possible if writing new Java code or alterations to existing code isn't required.
====

Take advantage of the web modeler to enhance your processes seamlessly while maintaining operational continuity.

== Overview

This view contains a *canvas* for modeling processes and a panel with *BPMN elements palette* on the left.
To configure process elements, select them on the canvas and set properties in the *properties panel* on the right.

At the top of the properties panel, you can see a *buttons panel*.
It contains the following buttons:

* Deploy process
* Open draft
* Save draft
* Download BPMN XML
* Upload BPMN XML

When you click the *Deploy process* button in the buttons panel,
the process will be deployed to the process engine and will be available for starting.

[[model-drafts]]
== Model Drafts

If you donâ€™t want the process model to be deployed and just want to save it to continue editing later,
use the *Save draft* button.

To export a process model, click the *Download* button.
XML file will be saved in the file system with the name as its _process id_ and extension `.bpmn20.xml`.

To import a process model, click the *Upload* button and select a file for downloading.
Then you can deploy it or save draft.

[WARNING]
====
BPMN models created in 3rd party tools can be incompatible with Jmix BPM.
And vice versa: Jmix models can be unreadable in 3rd party tools.

Special Jmix elements (Entity Data task, Email Sending task) will be represented
as regular service tasks in 3rd party tools.
But they keep its properties.
