When BPM add-on is installed, the BPM section appears in the main menu:

There are the following users' and administrative views:

* xref:menu-views/start-process-view.adoc[Start process]
//todo: report cosmetics -- Start Process -> Start process
* xref:menu-views/my-tasks.adoc[My tasks]
* xref:menu-views/modeler-web.adoc[Modeler]
* xref:menu-views/process-definitions.adoc[Process definitions]
* xref:menu-views/process-instances.adoc[Process instances]
* xref:menu-views/user-groups.adoc[User groups]
* xref:menu-views/user-tasks.adoc[User tasks]
* xref:menu-views/decision-tables.adoc[Decision tables]
* xref:menu-views/decision-table-modeler.adoc[Decision table modeler]


To access those views, users must be assigned to roles:

* *BPM: process actor* -- for _Start process_ and _My tasks_ views.
* *BPM: administration* -- for the rest views.
