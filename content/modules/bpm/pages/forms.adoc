= Process Forms

Process forms are views displayed to users. They may be configured for the `StartEvent` and `User Task` model elements. There are several process form types:

* *Jmix view* — a user interface view.
* *Input dialog* — a form is generated in the runtime when a user starts a process or completes a user task. Form fields are defined in the process model.
* *No form* — a process should be started programmatically.
* *Custom* — used if you need to render a form in a non-standard way.
