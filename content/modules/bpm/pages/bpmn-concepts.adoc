In BPMN, the messages and signals are a mechanism used to communicate between different elements within a business process.

Both messages and signals play a crucial role in defining the interactions and dependencies between various elements in a BPMN diagram.

Messages and signals must be defined *before* they can be used in events.

To define a message or signal in Studio, open a process model, select nothing to access the process properties and find signal and message definition sections:

In the web modeler you can find message and signal definitions in the process properties as well:

[[message-definition]]
=== Defining a Message
To create a message definition, you have to set its _id_ and _name_:

[[signal-definition]]
=== Defining a Signal

To create a signal definition, you have to set its _id_ and _name_; besides, you must select a _scope_ parameter, _Global_ or _Process instance_:

=== XML Representation

Message and signals definitions in XML file are located usually between _<process>_ and _<diagram>_ sections.

[source, xml]
----
  </process>
  <message id="green" name="Green" /> <1>
  <message id="yellow" name="Yellow" />
  <message id="red" name="Red" />
  <signal id="ready" name="Ready" flowable:scope="global" /> <2>
  <signal id="stop" name="Stop" flowable:scope="processInstance" />
  <bpmndi:BPMNDiagram id="BPMNDiagram_process">
----
<1> - Message definition
<2> - Signal definition

[NOTE]
====
If you plan to use the same messages and signals in various processes, you have to create their definitions in each BPMN model.
