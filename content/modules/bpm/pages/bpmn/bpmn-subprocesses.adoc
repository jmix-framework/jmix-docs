= Subprocesses

_Subprocess_ is an activity that contains other activities, gateways, events, and so on, which in itself forms a process that is part of the bigger process.

Subprocesses allow hierarchical modeling, resulting in a high-level, end-to-end overview of the business process. Subprocesses can be nested.

Besides, a subprocess creates a new xref:process-variables.adoc#variable-scopes[scope] for process variables and xref:bpmn/bpmn-events.adoc[events]. Events that are thrown during execution of the subprocess can be caught by a boundary event on the boundary of the subprocess, creating a scope for that event limited to the subprocess.

There are three types of subprocesses in Jmix BPM:

* xref:embedded-subprocess[Embedded subprocess]
* xref:event-subprocess[Event subprocess]
* xref:transaction-subprocess[Transaction subprocess]
* xref:call-activity[Call activity]

[[embedded-subprocess]]
== Embedded Subprocess

A subprocess completely defined inside a parent process is called _embedded_.
Embedded subprocesses aren't reusable. In other words, you can't call them from anywhere; they are a solid part of parent process.

=== Graphical Notation
A subprocess is typically represented as a rounded rectangle, similar to a regular task, but bigger size.
To create a subprocess, select image:bpmn-subprocesses/icon-subprocess.png[,30] from the palette and place it on the canvas.

image::bpmn-subprocesses/create-subprocess.png[,500]

Then you can drag-and-drop existing elements into subprocess or create new ones inside it.
An embedded subprocess can only have one _'none start event'_, no other start event types are allowed.

=== Properties

Embedded subprocess has no special properties, only general ones. You can set its name that will be shown as a label on its shape on the diagram.

image::bpmn-subprocesses/subprocess-properties.png[,500]

As well, a subprocess may be xref:transactions.adoc#asynchronous-continuation[asynchronous] and xref:multi-instance.adoc[multi-instance].


*Collapsing subprocess*

Many modeling tools allow subprocesses to be collapsed, hiding all the details of the subprocess.
//todo: сейчас не поддерживается свертываение-развертываение подпроцессов

=== XML representation

An embedded subprocess is defined by the _subProcess_ element. All activities, gateways, events, and son on, that are part of the subprocess need to be enclosed within this element.

[source,xml]
----
<subProcess id="Activity_17a4us1" name="Subprocess">
  <startEvent id="subProcessStart" />

... other subprocess elements ...

  <endEvent id="subProcessEnd" />
 </subProcess>
----

[[event-subprocess]]
== Event Subprocess

_Event subprocess_ is a subprocess triggered by an event.
It can be added at the process level or at any subprocess level.

The event used to trigger an event subprocess is configured using a start event.
An event subprocess might be triggered using events, such as message events, error events, signal events, timer events, or compensation events.
The subscription to the start event is created when the scope (process instance or subprocess) hosting the event subprocess is created. The subscription is to be removed when the scope is destroyed.

=== Graphical Notation

An event subprocess can be visualized is as a rounded rectangle with a dotted outline. To create event subprocess, you should add an embedded subprocess and then change it to event subprocess:

image::bpmn-subprocesses/creating-event-subprocess.png[,600]

Now you can go on designing event subprocess.

image::bpmn-subprocesses/creating-event-subprocess-2.png[,550]

[NOTE]
====
_None start events_ are not supported for event subprocesses. It doesn't cause error at deployment or runtime, but this subprocess will never be triggered.
====


=== XML Representation

An event subprocess is represented using XML in the same way as an embedded subprocess. In addition, the attribute _triggeredByEvent_ must have the value true:

[source,xml]
----
    <subProcess id="event-subprocess" name="Event subprocess" triggeredByEvent="true"> <1>
      <sequenceFlow id="Flow_14hzcqy" sourceRef="start-message-event" targetRef="Activity_0iuoq5t" />
      <startEvent id="start-message-event"> <2>
        <messageEventDefinition id="MessageEventDefinition_1hzz5hc" messageRef="cancel-order" />
      </startEvent>

... other subprocess elements ...

    </subProcess>

----
<1> -- _triggeredByEvent_ attribute
<2> -- Message start event

=== Example

The following is an example of an event subprocess triggered using an _Error Start Event_. The event subprocess is located at the "process level", in other words, is scoped to the process instance:

image::bpmn-subprocesses/event-subprocess-example.png[,500]

Event subprocess can be defined in embedded subprocess. In this case, when the error event is triggered, the event subprocess will have access to subprocess local variables:

image::bpmn-subprocesses/event-subprocess-error.png[,600]

When you use an error boundary event, the external event handler won't see local variables:

image::bpmn-subprocesses/subprocess-error.png[,600]

[[transaction-subprocess]]
== Transaction Subprocess


[[call-activity]]
== Call Activity

Call Activity is a type of activity that allows you to call a reusable process or a global task from within another process. It provides a way to break down complex processes into smaller, more manageable parts and promotes reusability.

Opposite to embedded subprocess, _call activity_ is an _external_ subprocess.

When process execution arrives at the call activity, a new execution is created that is a sub-execution of the execution that arrived at the call activity.
This sub-execution is then used to execute the subprocess, potentially creating parallel child executions, as within a regular process.
The super-execution waits until the subprocess has completely ended, and continues with the original process afterward.

=== Graphical Notation

A call activity is visualized by rounded rectangle as a normal task, but with a thick border and the subprocess xref:bpmn/bpmn-concepts.adoc#markers[marker] inside:

image::bpmn-subprocesses/call-activity.png[,300]

=== Properties

You can configure call activity by setting its properties:

image::bpmn-subprocesses/call-activity-properties.png[,450]

* *Called Element*: It is a reference to one of the existing process definitions.
//todo: если не будет решено иначе, что call activity надо специально объявлять
+
CAUTION: Avoid unmanaged recursion! Technically, it's possible to call another instance of the process from within itself.

* *Called Element Type*: In Studio, by default, is used _key_ parameter. It means the last version of the refered process will be called.
+
In web modeler, it's possible to call a specified version of the process by its _id_.

* *Business Key*: You can define it by expression or inherit from the parent process.

* *Variables Mapping*:

** First, call activity can inherit process variables from the parent process. It means when the called process will start, in it will be created process variables like in the parent process, but they will be new instances, not references to original ones.

** *In Mapping*: Here you can pass parameters into the called process using existing process variables (source) to variables in the called process (target):
+
image::bpmn-subprocesses/in-mapping.png[,350]
+
Or by expressions:
+
image::bpmn-subprocesses/in-mapping-expression.png[,350]

** *Out Mapping*: This way you can mirror variables from the called process (source) on the variables in the parent process (target):
+
image::bpmn-subprocesses/out-mapping.png[,350]
+
Or you can use expression.

=== XML representation

[source,xml]
----
    <callActivity id="Activity_08ermzt" name="Call activity"
                  calledElement="data-task-sample" <1>
                  flowable:inheritBusinessKey="true"> <2>
      <extensionElements>
        <flowable:in sourceExpression="${client.name}" <3>
                     target="clientName" />
        <flowable:out source="clientName"  <4>
                      target="clientName" />
      </extensionElements>
      <incoming>Flow_0sdrrfm</incoming>
    </callActivity>

----
<1> -- called element, by default referenced by process id (process definition key)
<2> -- business key will be inherited
<3> -- In mapping by expression
<4> -- out mapping by variable

[NOTE]
====
The process definition of the subprocess is resolved at runtime. This means that the subprocess can be deployed independently of the calling process, if needed.
====

==== User Tasks in Call Activity
If the called process has _user tasks_, assigned users will see them in the task list (_My tasks_ view) under the name of called process, not the parent.

So, if you want to manage all tasks from your process, and it has call activities, you should take care of this.
