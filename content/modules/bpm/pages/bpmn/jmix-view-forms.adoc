= Jmix View Process Forms

When you need a process form with a complex layout and behavior,
use xref:flow-ui:index.adoc[Jmix views] instead of xref:bpm:input-dialog.adoc[input dialog] forms.

[[processform-annotation]]
== `@ProcessForm` Annotation

A view controller should be annotated with the `@ProcessForm` annotation to be used as a process form.
This annotation has the following attributes:

* allowedProcessKeys
* outcomes
* params
* output variables

Using of these attributes described below.

[WARNING]
====
Avoid placing `@ProcessForm` annotation on existing Jmix views that were developed with other purposes.
Better create new ones from scratch with the help of the wizard or via extending existing views.

[[creating-jmix-view-form]]
== Creating Jmix View Form

First, set a _Jmix view_ form type for the user task or start event in the *BPMN Inspector* panel:

image::jmix-view-forms/set-jmix-view-type.png[,400]

Then, you'll be able to select an existing Jmix view process form in a pull-down list.
To create a new form click image:jmix-view-forms/plus-button.png[,25] _Plus_ button:

image::jmix-view-forms/create-jmix-view.png[,400]

The *View Creation Wizard* will open. Enter the descriptor and controller names and other parameters.

image::jmix-view-forms/jmix-view-wizard-1.png[,700]

Now, decide about the form template. There are two options available:
_Process form with process variables_ (default) or _Process form for entity instance_:

image::jmix-view-forms/form-template-select.png[,600]

About those options:

* By default, process variables of the _Entity_ type are represented in the form as _EntityPicker_ objects.
In the case when the user must select an entity instance from the list, it is OK.

* But if the user wants to have access to all entity's attributes, the _EntityPicker_ component isn't a suitable solution.
It would be more comfortable to have a form like standard entity detail view.
The second option allows to generate such a form automatically.

When selecting to create a _Process form for entity instance_, the wizard will ask about the entity class and fetch plan:

image::jmix-view-forms/form-wizard-entity-variable.png[,700]

However, by default, the checkbox _Use existing variable_ is on and these details will be hidden.

After you finish with the entity variable instance setting, the wizard offers to add process variables.
For example, let's add an `initiator` variable:

image::jmix-view-forms/add-variable.png[,900]

When it is added, you can decide whether to show it in the form or not:

image::jmix-view-forms/variable-to-form.png[,670]

Further, the wizard offers to define form outcomes.
By default, `submit` and `reject` outcomes are created.
You can edit them or add new ones.

image::jmix-view-forms/outcomes.png[,650]

At last, define messages that will be displayed in the form.
If there is more than one locale, you'll be able to enter messages for each language.

image::jmix-view-forms/wizard-messages.png[,650]

Here the wizard ends its work and opens the form controller window with generated code:

[source,java]
----
@ProcessForm(outcomes = {
        @Outcome(id = "submit"),
        @Outcome(id = "reject")
}, outputVariables = {
        @OutputVariable(name = "initiator", type = User.class),
        @OutputVariable(name = "orderVar", type = Order.class)
})
@Route(value = "order-approval-form", layout = MainView.class)
@ViewController("smpl_OrderApprovalForm")
@ViewDescriptor("order-approval-form.xml")
public class OrderApprovalForm extends StandardView {

    @Autowired
    private ProcessFormContext processFormContext;
    @ProcessVariable(name = "initiator")
    @ViewComponent
    private EntityPicker<User> initiatorField;
    @ProcessVariable(name = "orderVar")
    private Order orderVar;
    @ViewComponent
    DataContext dataContext;
    @ViewComponent
    private InstanceContainer<Order> orderDc;

    @Subscribe
    public void onBeforeShow(final BeforeShowEvent event) {
        if (orderVar == null) {
            orderVar = dataContext.create(Order.class);
        }
        orderDc.setItem(dataContext.merge(orderVar));
    }

    @Subscribe(id = "submitBtn", subject = "clickListener")
    protected void onSubmitBtnClick(ClickEvent<JmixButton> event) {
        dataContext.save();
        processFormContext.taskCompletion()
                .withOutcome("submit")
                .saveInjectedProcessVariables()
                .complete();
        closeWithDefaultAction();
    }

    @Subscribe(id = "rejectBtn", subject = "clickListener")
    protected void onRejectBtnClick(ClickEvent<JmixButton> event) {
        dataContext.save();
        processFormContext.taskCompletion()
                .withOutcome("reject")
                .saveInjectedProcessVariables()
                .complete();
        closeWithDefaultAction();
    }
}

[[process-variables]]
== Process Variables

To pass process variables into the Jmix view form, you have to inject them in the controller.
For this purpose, place `@ProcessVariable` annotation on injected UI components or regular class fields.

It indicates that the value of the process variable will be written to this field when the process form is opened.
In the case of the UI component, the value of the process variable will be set to the UI component.

Normally, the name of the annotated field in the controller matches the name of the process variable.
If not, use optional `name` attribute of `@ProcessVariable` annotation.
The value of this attribute must be the process variable name.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/StartProcessForm1.java[tags=variables]
----

To return process variables updated values back to the process,
you can invoke the <<process-form-context,ProcessFormContext>> with the `saveInjectedProcessVariables()` method.
In result, the values of annotated fields will be saved as process variables.

The wizard implements this behavior by default in click events handlers.
Or you can do this anywhere in your custom code.


[[process-form-context]]
== ProcessFormContext

The `ProcessFormContext` object contains information about a process definition to be started
(when the form is used for starting the process) or a user task to be completed.

You can use `ProcessFormContext` if the process form is opened from the *Start process* and *My tasks* views.
If you need to open the process form with the injected `ProcessFormContext` programmatically,
use the <<opening-forms-programmatically,ProcessFormViews>> bean.

The `ProcessFormContext` object also contains methods for starting the process and task completion.

[[start-form-example]]
An example of how to start a process:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/StartProcessForm1.java[tags=start-process]
----

<1> Creates a `ProcessStarting` instance.
<2> Sets a business key to the process instance.[[business-key]]
<3> Adds a process variable.
<4> Starts the actual process.
<5> Closes the opened window.

[[task-form-example]]
An example of how to complete the user task:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/TaskProcessForm.java[tags=complete-task1;complete-task2]
----

<1> Creates a `TaskCompletion` instance.
<2> Sets a task outcome.
<3> Indicates that values of class fields annotated with the `@ProcessVariables` should be collected and saved as process variables.
<4> Completes the actual task.
<5> Closes the opened window.

[[declare-task-outcomes]]
== Declare Task Outcomes

In the BPM modeler, for the xref:bpmn/bpmn-sequence-flow.adoc[sequence flow] element,
you can define a condition by selecting a user task and its outcome from the drop-down list.
To fill this list for a user task that uses a Jmix view process form,
you can declare a list of possible outcomes in the form controller.
Use the `outcomes` attribute of the `@ProcessForm` annotation for that.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/OrderApprovalTaskForm.java[tags=outcomes]
----

[[process-form-parameters]]
== Process Form Parameters

Jmix view process forms can accept external parameters defined in the modeler.
The form parameters used by the form are defined in the `params` attribute of the `@ProcessForm` annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/ActorSelectionForm.java[tags=params]
----

These parameters are read by the *Bpmn Inspector*, and you can see them after selecting the view.

image::jmix-view-forms/form-params.png[,400]

You can edit the parameters and provide a direct param value or use one of the existing process variables as a parameter value.

In the process form controller, use the `@ProcessFormParam` annotation on class fields to get parameter values.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/ActorSelectionForm.java[tags=params-annotation]
----

Another way to get a full list of process form parameters is to get them from the `ProcessFormContext` object:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/ActorSelectionForm.java[tags=param-list]
----

As the `@ProcessVariable` annotation, the `@ProcessFormParam` supports an optional `name` attribute.
If the attribute is not defined, then a field name is used as a parameter name.

See an <<process-form-with-parameters,example>> of a process form with parameters.

[[output-variables]]
== Output Variables

When you model the process,
it may be useful to know which variables are set by the Jmix view process form in order to reuse them later in the process model.
A way to achieve this is to use the `outputVariabes` attribute of the `@ProcessForm` annotation.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/OutputVariablesForm.java[tags=output-variables]
----

Then, you will see the _Output variable_ section in the *BPMN Inspector* panel. This section is read-only.

image::jmix-view-forms/output-variables.png[,400]

Often there are cases when a process variable is set only when the task is completed using a particular outcome.
To declare this, place the `outputVariables` annotation attribute to the `@Outcome` annotation.


[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/OutcomeOutputVariablesForm.java[tags=output-variables]
----

<1> The `nextActor` variable can be set when the task is completed with the `approve` outcome.
<2> The `rejectionReason` variable can be set when the task is completed with the `reject` outcome.
<3> The `comment` variable can be set in any case.

Output variables with the corresponding outcomes will be displayed.

image::jmix-view-forms/output-variables-outcomes.png[,400]

[[restrict-process-form-usage]]
== Restrict Process Form Usage

By default, all process forms views are available within any process model.
If you want to use some view in particular processes only,
then you should specify processes keys in the `allowedProcessKeys` attribute of the `@ProcessForm` annotation.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/StartProcessForm1.java[tags=allowed-process]
----

The form will be available only for processes with `process-1` or `process-2` process ids.

[[opening-forms-programmatically]]
== Opening Forms Programmatically

You can use the `ProcessFormViews` service to create start process forms and task process forms defined in the modeler.

In the example below, the start process form is opened by clicking the button in the browser view.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/order/OrderListView.java[tags=start-form]
----
<1> Gets a process definition with the `order-process` key.
<2> Shows the start process form with the received process definition.

The start process form can look like an example in the <<start-form-example,ProcessFormContext>> section.

To create a task form, use the `openTaskProcessForm` method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/test/TestScreen.java[tags=task-form]
----

The task process form can look like an example in the <<task-form-example,ProcessFormContext>> section.

[[examples]]
== Examples

[[start-process-form]]
=== Start Process Form

Let's look at the example of the process form that is used as a start form.
The form displays two fields:

* A text field to enter the order number.
* An entityPicker to select the manager. The manager can be the next process actor.

View controller:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/OrderApprovalStartForm.java[tags=start-example]
----

<1> The `@ProcessForm` annotation indicates that this view is a process form and the view will be available in the modeler.
<2> We declare that the injected `orderNumber` UI component is a process variable. Since we develop a start process form,
the variable has no value yet, but the annotation will be used on process start.
<3> The same as 2, but here the `manager` process variable name differs from the `managerEntityPicker` field name.
<4> `ProcessFormContext` is the object that we use to start the process.
<5> When we start the process, we can pass an optional process instance business key.
We use the `orderNumber` here.
<6> The `saveInjectedProcessVariables()` indicates that values of the fields annotated with
the `@ProcessVariables` should be saved as process variables on process start.

Instead of using `saveInjectedProcessVariables()` method you can explicitly set process variables:

----

[[task-process-form]]
=== Task Process Form

Let's look at the example of the task process form that displays two fields:

* The first one will display a value of the existing process variable - `orderNumber`.
* The second field will be used for the new process variable - `comment`.

*Approve* and *Reject* buttons complete the user task with the corresponding outcome.

View controller:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/bpm-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/bpmex1/view/forms/OrderApprovalTaskForm.java[tags=task-example]
----

<1> The form defines two possible outcomes that can be used in a sequence flow node condition in the modeler.
This information is used by the modeler only.
<2> The `orderNumber` variable has been already set on process start.
Because of the `@ProcessVariable` annotation,
the value of the `orderNumber` process variables will be set to the `orderNumber` text field when the form is displayed.
<3> The comment variable is not set yet, but the `@ProcessVariable` annotation will be taken into account
when we complete the task in the button click listener.
<4> Values of all fields annotated with the `@ProcessVariable` will be saved as process variables on task completion.
<5> An alternative way to define process variables. Instead of using the `saveInjectedProcessVariables()` method,
you can define process variables directly.

[[process-form-with-parameters]]
=== Process Form with Parameters

Let's assume that you need a form for the next process actor selection.
The form should display `EntityPicker` field with users and save the result into a process variable.
We want to use the form for selecting different actors at different process steps,
so the form should have two parameters:

* `variableName`
* `entityPickerCaption`
