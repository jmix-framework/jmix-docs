= Gateways

== Description
Gateways are used to control the flow of a process by determining under what conditions a process should proceed along different paths. Each type of gateway serves a specific purpose in directing the flow of a process based on certain conditions or events.

Gateways help to model decision points, branching, merging, and synchronization within a process, allowing for more complex and dynamic process flows to be represented accurately.

[[gateway-types]]
=== Gateway Types

There are four types of BPMN gateways supported in *Jmix BPM*:

* Exclusive gateway
* Parallel gateway
* Inclusive gateway
* Event-based gateway

A *Complex gateway* isn't supported.

[[grapical-gateways]]
=== Graphical Representation of Gateways

All gateways are visualized as diamond shapes with different icons inside:

[[forks-and-joins]]
=== Fork and Join Gateways

All gateways except _Event-based_ can be used in the process model in two roles:

* *Fork* -- where the process splits in several paths
* *Join* -- where paths merge

As a rule, fork and join gateways are paired, but it isn't mandatory. If the process was split once, each path can continue until the _End event_.

[NOTE]
====
Gateways are used to control the flow of the process execution by generating  or consuming tokens.

[[gateway-properties]]
=== Gateway Properties

All gateways have only general properties:

* Id
* Name

[[exclusive-gateway]]
== Exclusive Gateway

An exclusive gateway (or XOR-gateway) is used to model a decision in the process based on data, for example, on process variables values or values returned by bean method.

When the execution arrives at this gateway, all conditions associated with outgoing sequence flows are evaluated in the order in which sequence flows are defined.

The *first* sequence flow whose condition evaluates to _true_ to be selected for continuing the process. Empty condition is considered as always _true_.

The term "first" in this context refers to the order in which sequence flows are defined in the XML file body, not necessarily the order in which they appear in the gateway description.

This distinction emphasizes that the sequencing of flows is based on the XML file structure rather than the visual representation or textual description of the flows within the gateway.

People often use questions as a name of exclusive gateway. For example, "Is the document approved?" But the gateway itself doesn't have any internal logic. To make a gateway really work, conditions must be defined on the outgoing flows.

'''

[[gateways-conditions]]
=== Conditions

A condition defines when a flow is taken. In *Jmix BPM*, condition can be set from the following sources:

* Expression
* User task outcomes
* Business rule task result

image::bpmn-gateways/condition-source.png[,400]

[CAUTION]
====
Double check if all required conditions on outgoing flows are defined. Otherwise, if they are empty, the first one be selected. Text label over arrows means nothing for the BPM engine.
====

==== Expressions

It is a boolean expression that can access the process variables and compare them with literals or other variables. As well, it's possible to call Spring bean methods here.

For example:

 ${orderAmount > 1000}
 ${price > 100 && price <= 500}
 ${accountant.username == "jane"}
 ${jbt_MyService.getRandom > 0.5}
 ${jbt_MyService.evaluateCondition()}

In the last case, method must return _boolean_ value.

==== User Task Outcomes

If there is in the process a user task with outcomes, you can select a certain outcome that activates the given flow.

image::bpmn-gateways/exclisive-gateway-task-outcome.png[]

To set up outcome-based condition, select a user task, then outcome.

When selecting a user task for condition, be sure that it is to be executed *BEFORE* the condition is evaluated. Otherwise, it  causes an error at runtime.

// image::exclusive-gateway-wrong-task.png[,300]
// image::exclusive-gateway-wrong-condition.png[,300]

*Conditions and Multi-instance user task*

When a user task is multi-instance, an additional parameter appears -- _condition type_:
//todo: reference to multi-instance

image::bpmn-gateways/outcome-based-condition-types.png[,300]

There are the following options:

* Anyone completed with the outcome
* Everyone completed with the outcome
* No one completed with the outcome

Using this parameter, you can arrange some kind of voting. For example, this flow will be selected when at least one user has completed the task with the outcome 'yes'.

image::bpmn-gateways/outcome-based-condition.png[,600]

==== Business Rule Task Result

A business rule task returns a result that can be used in gateway's condition.
//todo: link to business rule

image::bpmn-gateways/exclusive-gateway-business-rule.png[,600]

To set up a condition, based on the business rule result, select a business rule task, decision table output variable, and output value.

Be sure that selected business rule task is executed *BEFORE* the gateway.


[[default-flow]]
=== Default Flow

If there is one of outgoing flows marked as default (by the slash line across), it'd be selected only when all other flow conditions are _false_.

If the default flow has a condition, it'd be ignored.

It is highly recommended to use a default flow when modeling an exclusive gateway. However, it isn't mandatory.

image::bpmn-gateways/default-flow-example.png[,300]

[[using-exlusive-gateway]]
=== Using Exclusive Gateway

==== Separate Forks and Joins

Formally, BPMN specification allows to use one gateway in two roles, but such usage is highly not recommended.

So, avoid using an exclusive gateway as shown in the picture, where the gateway is fork and join at once:

image::bpmn-gateways/exclusive-gateway-mixed-roles.png[,400]

Better to separate gateway's roles like shown in the next picture with two gateways, one for join and the other for fork:

image::bpmn-gateways/exclusive-gateway-example-2.png[,400]

'''

==== Multiple True Conditions

image::bpmn-gateways/exclusive-gateway-two-true-conditions.png[,250]

In this example, you can see exclusive gateway with two obvious conditions that both are true. Condition #1 will be evaluated first because it appears in the process XML file higher than condition #2. However, in the gateway description condition #2 stays first.

==== Cascades of Exclusive Gateways

Exclusive gateway works like a 'SWITCH' operator in programming, not like 'IF'. It may have as many outgoing flows as you need.

It means you shouldn't build cascades of YES-NO gateways, you can use more smart conditions to select right outbound sequence flow.

So, don't model like this:

image::bpmn-gateways/exclusive-gateway-cascade.png[,500]

Here we see to gateways for evaluating atomic conditions _Sky == blue_ and _Sea == green_. If both of them are true, the process goes further. But the model looks complicated.

When we use more advanced conditions, we can avoid cascades of gateways:

image::bpmn-gateways/exclusive-gateway-no-cascade.png[,350]

In this picture, we use a combined condition _Sky == blue && Sea == green_, thus the one only one gateway is needed.

[[parallel-gateway]]
== Parallel Gateway

A parallel gateway (or AND-gateway) is used to split a process flow into multiple parallel paths or to merge multiple parallel paths back into a single flow.

image::bpmn-gateways/parallel-gateway-example.png[,600]

When execution arrives in the parallel gateway, the process splits in the number of paths equals the number of outgoing flows.

If there is a join parallel gateway, the process waits until all incoming flows be executed. In other words, until all parallel paths will reach the join gateway. Then the process continues past the joining gateway.

Actually, it isn't mandatory to join parallel paths all together. Each of them may have its own _End event_. But the whole process ends only after *ALL* parallel path be finished.

=== Conditions

Conditions on the outgoing flows from the parallel gateway are ignored.

=== Default Flow

Default flow in parallel gateway is ignored.

=== Using Parallel Gateway

==== Separate Forks and Joins

Do not use the same parallel gateway as fork and join:

image::bpmn-gateways/parallel-gateway-bad-example.png[,550]

Formally it's possible, but highly not recommended.

==== Use Cascades

Note that a parallel gateway does not need to be 'balanced' (a matching number of incoming/outgoing sequence flows for corresponding parallel gateways).

A parallel gateway will simply wait for all incoming sequence flows and create a concurrent path of execution for each outgoing sequence flow, not influenced by other constructs in the process model. So, the following process is legal in BPMN 2.0:

image::bpmn-gateways/parallel-gateway-cascaded.png[,600]

And this model is valid as well:

image::bpmn-gateways/parallel-gateway-cascaded-2.png[,550]

[[inclusive-gateway]]
== Inclusive Gateway

The inclusive gateway (or OR-gateway) can be seen as a combination of an _Exclusive_ and a _Parallel_ gateway.

Like an exclusive gateway, you can define conditions on outgoing sequence flows and the inclusive gateway will evaluate them.

But the main difference is that the inclusive gateway can take more than one sequence flow, like the parallel gateway.

This differs from the parallel gateway as it only waits for incoming flows that will be executed (whose conditions were evaluated true). After the join, the process continues past the inclusive gateway.

image::bpmn-gateways/inclusive-gateway-example.png[,650]

In this example, the first user fills a checklist, where marks who must participate in the approval process. It differs from the parallel process as only selected employees will receive the approval task.

Suppose, it were an _Accountant_ and a _Team leader_ selected. Then _join_ gateway will wait until both of them complete the task.

=== Conditions

In inclusive gateway, conditions are configured the same way, like in exclusive gateway.

=== Default Flow

If there is a _default_ sequence flow, this branch will always be executed.

[[event-based-gateway]]
== Event-based Gateway

The event-based gateway provides a way to take a decision based on events.

An event-based gateway must have at least two outgoing sequence flows. Each sequence flow must be connected to an intermediate catch event of type timer, message or signal.
//todo: make links

No other activities are allowed right after event-based gateway.

When process execution reaches an event-based gateway, the gateway acts like a *wait state*: execution is suspended.

In addition, for each outgoing sequence flow, an event subscription is created.

Which event would be triggered first, that path the process will flow.

Note the sequence flows running out of an Event-based Gateway are different from ordinary sequence flows. These sequence flows are never actually "executed". On the contrary, they allow the process engine to determine which events and execution arriving at an Event-based Gateway needs to subscribe to.

image::bpmn-gateways/event-based-gateway.png[,300]

=== Conditions

In event-based gateway, all conditions on outgoing flows will be ignored.

=== Default Flow

The _default_ mark on the outgoing flow will be ignored.

=== Using Event-based Gateway

A typical case where using of event-based gateway is a request to unreliable external service. That service can fall down or return an error any time the process sends a request.

With an event-based gateway, you can model it like shown in the picture:

image::bpmn-gateways/event-based-gateway-usage.png[,500]

In this example, the service task sends a request to service and then the process arrives to event-based gateway, which is a wait state.

We have three options here:

* *Success* -- OK message received and the process continues its normal path
* *Failure* -- Error message received and here you can proceed it; If needed, you can use different messages for errors.
* *Timeout* -- Time expired, and you have to decide what to do; probably, repeat request attempt.

This pattern makes a diagram more clear and better understandable.
