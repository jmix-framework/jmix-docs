= Using BPMN 2.0


BPMN elements are the building blocks used to represent the various components and activities within a business process.
These elements are designed to be easily understandable by all business stakeholders, including business analysts, developers, and business managers.

== Element Types

BPMN elements can be categorized into several types, each serving a specific purpose in the modeling of business processes:

1. *Flow Objects*: The main elements that define the behavior of the process.
- xref:bpmn/bpmn-events.adoc[**Events**]: Represent something that happens during the process (that are _start_, _intermediate_, _end_).
- *Activities*: xref:bpmn/bpmn-tasks.adoc[Tasks] or xref:bpmn/bpmn-subprocesses.adoc[subprocesses] that are performed (that is, user tasks, service tasks, script tasks).
- xref:bpmn/bpmn-gateways.adoc[*Gateways*]: Control the flow of the process by determining branching, forking, merging, and joining of paths.

2. *Connecting Objects*: Elements that connect flow objects and define the flow of the process.
- xref:bpmn/bpmn-sequence-flow.adoc[*Sequence Flows*]: Indicate the order of activities in the process (image:bpmn-elements/sequence-flow.png[,80]).
- *Message Flows*: Show the flow of messages between different participants or processes (image:bpmn-elements/message-flow.png[,120]).
- *Association*: Links artifacts to flow objects, providing additional information (image:bpmn-elements/compensation-flow.png[,80]).
- *Compensation Flows*: Connects a _Compensation handler_ with compensating activity (image:bpmn-elements/compensation-flow.png[,80]).
- *Comment Links*: Shows the object the comment is attached to (image:bpmn-elements/comment-link.png[,80]).

3. *Swimlanes*: Visual elements that organize the activities in a process by grouping them into different roles or responsibilities.
- xref:bpmn/bpmn-pools-lanes.adoc#pools[*Pools*]: Represent major participants in a process (e.g., organizations).
- xref:bpmn/bpmn-pools-lanes.adoc#lanes[*Lanes*]: Subdivisions within a pool that represent specific roles or responsibilities.

4. *Artifacts*: Additional information that can be attached to the process to provide context.
- *Data Objects*: Represent data that is required or produced by activities.
- *Groups*: Visual elements that group different tasks but do not affect the flow.
- *Annotations**: Provide additional information about the process.


[[markers]]
== Markers

A _marker_ refers to specific symbols or indicators used within the graphical representation of a process to convey additional information about the activities or events.

Markers are visual elements that provide quick insights into the behavior or characteristics of a process element. They help to differentiate between various types of activities, events, or gateways.

Types of markers:

* *Subprocess Marker*: A plus sign (image:bpmn-elements/subprocess-marker.png[,20]) in the upper left corner of a rounded rectangle indicates that the activity is a subprocess that can be expanded to show its internal details.

* *Event Markers*: Different symbols within circles can indicate the type of event (e.g., message, timer, error) and whether it is a catching or throwing event.

* *Multi-instance markers*: Three short vertical (image:bpmn-elements/multi-parallel.png[,15]) or horizontal (image:bpmn-elements/multi-sequential.png[,20]) lines indicating that an activity (task or subprocess) can be executed multiple times in parallel or sequentially.

* *Compensation marker*: A rewind symbol (image:bpmn-elements/compensation-marker.png[,20]) indicating this activity is a _compensation handler_.
