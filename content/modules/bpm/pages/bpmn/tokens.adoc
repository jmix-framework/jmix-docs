= Tokens

The token is a key concept in BPMN that helps to understand and define the behavior of a process during execution. A token represents the current state of the process and serves as a means to visualize how the process behaves at runtime.

When a process is started, a token is created, typically initiated by a start event. This token flows through the process, following the sequence flows and interacting with the process elements it encounters. At parallel gateways, the token can split into multiple tokens, and at other points in the process, these tokens can merge back. The token is consumed when it reaches an end event, which signifies the completion of the process instance.

Each process instance has its own token that tracks the state of that specific instance. Multiple process instances can run concurrently, with each maintaining its own token. When a token arrives at an activity, it becomes ready to start, and it interacts with gateways to determine the path it will follow. It is important to note that tokens cannot traverse message flows; only messages can flow along message flows.

The concept of tokens is crucial as they help to define and visualize the dynamic behavior of a process. They enable an understanding of how a process will execute without actually running it, providing a way to debug and test process models by tracing their flow.

[NOTE]
====
Direct access to tokens in the context of BPMN execution (as in tracking or manipulating process tokens) is not explicitly provided through the Flowable API.
Instead, the Flowable API primarily focuses on managing process instances, tasks, and events rather than exposing tokens as a separate entity.
