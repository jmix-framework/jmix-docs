= Process

A *process* is defined as a structured flow of activities that are performed to achieve a specific organizational goal.
In the BPMN model, a process is a root element containing all other elements.

.*Graphical Notation*

A process has no visual representation. Anyway, when you are in the modeler, an empty canvas already has a process definition.

A process can be encapsulated into a xref:bpmn/bpmn-pools-lanes.adoc#pools[pool]. In this case, the pool visually represents the process, but using pools isn't mandatory.


*XML Representation*

In the XML, the process is represented by `process` element. By default, it has an attribute `isExecutable` equals `true` that can be omitted.

//todo: на самом деле процесс запускается при любом значении атрибута. Надо уточнить, как должно быть

[source,xml]
----
  <process id="new-process" name="New process" isExecutable="true" >
    . . .
 </process>
----

Additionally, the process may have `processType`, `isClosed`, and `definitionalCollaborationRef` attributes that are ignored in Jmix BPM.

[[properties]]
.*Properties*

Here are the process properties in the *BPM Navigator*:

image::bpmn-process/process-properties.png[,400]

ID::
The *process ID* identifies the process when it is deployed. In runtime, it is called *process key*.
+
[NOTE]
====
When creating a process in Jmix Studio, the system automatically sets the process ID to match the file name. While this is not a strict requirement, you have the flexibility to change the process ID as needed.
However, it is considered best practice to keep the process ID and file name identical for consistency and easier identification.
====

Name::
The *name* property describes what the process does. Its maximal length is 255 characters.

[[starter-candidates]]
Starter candidates::
Users that allowed to start the process. They can be defined by *Candidate groups* and/or *Candidate users*. It is the same as setting candidates in the *User task*, see details xref:bpmn/bpmn-user-task.adoc#task-candidate-users-and-groups[here].
+
If the user is among candidates, he or she will see this process definition in the xref:menu-views/start-process-view.adoc[Start process] view.

Event listeners::
See xref:listeners.adoc#execution-listeners[listeners].
//todo: needs testing

Definitions::
Here you can create xref:bpmn/bpmn-events.adoc#event-definitions[event definitions] for messages, signals, and errors.

Documentation::
Place here a process description. The maximal length is 4000 characters.
