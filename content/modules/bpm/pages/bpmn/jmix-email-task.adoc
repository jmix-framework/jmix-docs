= Email Sending Task

[[overview]]
== Overview
*Email Sending Task* allows you to send emails while process execution.
For successful sending, the xref:email:index.adoc[Email] add-on should be installed.

This is a custom task developed by Jmix, not BPMN standard task.

*Graphical Notation*

A service task is visualized as a rounded rectangle with a small envelope icon in the top-left corner.
The icon is filled to represent task sending semantics.

*Properties*

An email  task has the following properties:

To configure email task:

* First, you have to set xref:bpmn/bpmn-tasks.adoc#common-task-properties[general task properties].

* Then, set specific email parameters.

* Create _Execution listeners_ if necessary.

* About the _Async_ flag, see details in the xref:bpmn/transactions.adoc[Transactions] section.

[NOTE]
====
Email sending task doesn't have multi-instance properties available.
But you can use it within an embedded subprocess that is multi-instanced.
See the xref:bpm:bpmn/multi-instance-activities.adoc[Multi-Instance] section.

[[email-parameters]]
== Email Parameters

The email task has common parameters while sending emails -- addressee, sender, subject, etc.

[[set-address]]
=== Set Addresses

There are few fields with addresses:
*To*, *Cc*, *Bcc*, and *From*.

The first three can contain a list of emails, so use *Email Address Editor* to fill them by clicking
image:jmix-email-task/edit-button.png[,25] _Edit_ button.

You can use a process variable or expression to provide the address, or specify it directly.
Several addresses are possible and can be set in the editor:

*From* is a senderâ€™s address, so it can be only one. Because of that, the address editor isn't used. You can place here a direct value or expression as well.

* *Subject* - an email subject. You can use a process variable in the subject.
* *Content* - a body of the email. In the editor, you can select the type of content: HTML or plain text. Using process variables is available.

[WARNING]
====
Don't miss this parameter with the *Async* flag common for all tasks.
====

[[attachements-content]]
=== Attachments & Content
* *Attachments* - a file content.
It should be specified as an expression: a process variable or a Spring bean method call.
The `File`, `FileRef`, `byte[]`, and `FileDescription` types are supported.
+
Providing an attachment name is optional.
If the name is not specified, it will be taken from the file content.
In case of `byte[]` as a file content, the default `attachment_<incremental_part>` naming will be used.
