// JST-5243 Email sending tasks -- not possible to set parameters


*Email Sending Task* allows you to send emails while process execution. For successful sending, the xref:email:index.adoc[Email] add-on should be installed.

This is a custom task developed by Jmix, not BPMN standard task.

*Graphical Notation*

A service task is visualized as a rounded rectangle with a small envelope icon in the top-left corner. The icon is filled to represent task sending semantics.

*Properties*

An email  task has the following properties:

To configure email task:

* First, you have to set xref:bpmn/bpmn-tasks.adoc#common-task-properties[general task properties].

* Then, set specific email parameters.

* Create _Execution listeners_ if necessary.

* About the _Async_ flag, see details in the xref:bpmn/transactions.adoc[Transactions] section.

[NOTE]
====
Email sending task doesn't have multi-instance properties available.
But you can use it within an embedded subprocess that is multi-instanced.
See the xref:bpm:bpmn/multi-instance-activities.adoc[Multi-Instance] section.

== Email Parameters

The email task has common parameters while sending emails -- addressee, sender, subject, etc.

=== Set Addresses

There are few fields with addresses:
*To*, *Cc*, *Bcc*, and *From*.

The first three can contain a list of emails, so use *Email Address Editor* to fill them by clicking
image:jmix-email-task/edit-button.png[,25] _Edit_ button.

You can use a process variable or expression to provide the address, or specify it directly. Several addresses are possible and can be set in the editor:

*From* is a sender’s address, so it can be only one. Because of that, the address editor isn't used. You can place here a direct value or expression as well.

* *Subject* - an email subject. You can use a process variable in the subject.
* *Content* - a body of the email. In the editor, you can select the type of content: HTML or plain text. Using process variables is available.


* *Send asynchronously* - by default, emails are sent asynchronously.
* *Attachments* - a file content. It should be specified as an expression: a process variable or a Spring bean method call. The `File`, `FileRef`, `byte[]`, and `FileDescription` types are supported.

Providing an attachment name is optional. If the name is not specified, it will be taken from the file content. In case of `byte[]` as a file content, the default `attachment_<incremental_part>` naming will be used.
