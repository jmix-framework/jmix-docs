= Process Forms

Process forms are views displayed to users.
They may be configured for the *Start Event* and *User Task* model elements.
There are several process form types:

* *No form* — a process should be started programmatically (default).
* xref:input-dialog.adoc[*Input dialog*] — a form is generated in the runtime when a user starts a process or opens a user task.
Form fields are defined in the process model.
* xref:bpm:bpmn/jmix-view-forms.adoc[*Jmix view*] — a user interface view.
// * *Custom* — used if you need to render a form in a non-standard way.
