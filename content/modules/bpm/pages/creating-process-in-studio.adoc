= Creating Process in Studio

For developers, the BPMN Modeler in Studio serves as the primary tool for creating automated processes.
It offers features beyond pure modeling, including:

* Navigation to process models through the Jmix project tree.
* BPM Inspector for manipulating the properties of BPMN elements.
* Entity Data Task: an extended BPMN component that enables manipulating with Jmix entities directly within the process.
* Wizard for JPQL queries to load entities.
* Wizard for Jmix view process forms.
* Suggestions and hints where applicable.
* Generation of Spring beans and Java delegate templates in the context of the process.
* Process deployment at application startup and hot deployment.

== Modeling Process in Studio

In the Jmix Tool window, find the BPM node.
Right click on it and create a new BPMN model.

For our reimbursement process, fill the form:

* *Process id*: `reimbursement`
* *Name*: `Reimbursement` (will be filled automatically)

image::bpm:getting-started/create-process-studio.png[,400]

Then find a documentation field in the *BPMN Navigator* panel and fill it:

image::getting-started/fill-documentation-studio.png[,800]

[[creating-start-form]]
=== Creating Start Form

Each element on the canvas has its own properties.
At the moment the only element present is `StartEvent`.
It represents the xref:bpm:getting-started-testing-process.adoc#start-form[Start form]
seen by the user initiating the process.
Let's configure it:

* Click on the `StartEvent` element to select it.
+
* Select `Input dialog` in the *Form Type* field. Its *Open mode* is automatically set to *Dialog*.
+
image::getting-started/start-form-studio.png[,800]

Next, create input parameters to prompt the user to enter values to this form:

* Click _create_ in the 'Parameters' field
and add `requestNumber` parameter with the following properties:

image::getting-started/request-number-studio.png[,800]


* Repeat the previous step to create three more input parameters:
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Process variable | Caption | Type | Editable | Required

|`expenseAmount`
|Expense amount
|Decimal (double)
|true
|true

|`expenseDate`
|Expense Date
|Date
|true
|true

|`document`
|Document
|File
|true
|true

|===

In result, you'll get all fields created:

image::getting-started/start-form-filled-studio.png[,800]

* Next, create an input parameter to let users select a manager for approval.
This will require a few additional properties:
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"]
|===
|Process variable | Caption | Type | Editable | Required | Entity name | UI Component | JPQL query

|`manager`
|Manager
|Entity
|true
|true
|User
|ComboBox
|_leave blank^*^_
|===
+
__^*^ If no query is specified, this field defaults to__ `select e from User e`.
+
image::getting-started/manager-field-studio.png[,800]
+
+
*  Set `requestNumber` as the *Business key* field value.
A xref:bpm:bpm-concepts.adoc#business-key[business key] is a domain-specific identifier of a process instance.

After adding all the parameters, the *Form* section should look as follows:

image::getting-started/set-business-key-studio.png[,800]

[[creating-approval-task]]
=== Creating Approval Task

Create a task for approval.
It will be represented by the xref:bpm:getting-started-testing-process.adoc#approval-form[Approval form]
seen by the manager assigned to approve the reimbursement.

First, add a new element on the canvas:

* Click on the `StartEvent` element to select it.
* Click the *Append task* image:quick-start/append-task-icon.png[width="20"] icon.
* Click the *Change type* image:quick-start/change-type-icon.png[width="20"] icon
and select *User Task* in the drop-down.
+
// image::getting-started/add-user-task-studio.png[,800]
image::getting-started/manager-assigned-studio.png[,800]
+
TIP: By default, the built-in `initiator` process variable is available to assign a task.
+
* Proceed to the *Form* section and specify the following properties:
** *Form type*: `Input dialog`
** *Open mode*: `Dialog` (this will be set by default)

* Click the [image:bpm:getting-started/create-btn.png[,60] link button] and
add the following existing parameters making them non-editable:
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Process variable | Caption | Type | Editable | Required

|`requestNumber`
|Request number
|String
|false
|false

|`expenseAmount`
|Expense amount
|Decimal (double)
|false
|false

|`expenseDate`
|Expense Date
|Date
|false
|false

|`document`
|Document
|File
|false
|false
|===
+
* Click the [image:bpm:getting-started/create-btn.png[,60] link button]
and create one additional parameter for this form:
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Process variable | Caption | Type | Editable | Required

|`comment`
|Comment
|Multiline string
|true
|false
|===
+
This parameter will be represented by a text field allowing the manager to leave notes during the approval step.
+
image::getting-started/user-task-form-1.png[,800]

[[creating-outcomes]]
=== Creating Outcomes

The *Approval* step has two outcomes: approved or rejected.
Therefore, the manager making decision, should see two buttons on the form.

* Make sure the Approval element is selected.
Then go to *Outcomes* properties and click the [image:bpm:getting-started/create-btn.png[,60] link button].

* Set properties for the first outcome:

image::getting-started/approval-outcomes.png[,800]

Depending on the *Approval* task's outcome, two scenarios are possible.
To indicate a point with several alternative paths, add an Exclusive Gateway element:

* Select the *Approval* task element and click *Append Gateway* image:quick-start/append-gateway-icon.png[width="20"].
* Select the gateway element and create another user task with image:quick-start/append-task-icon.png[width="20"] -> image:quick-start/change-type-icon.png[width="20"] -> *User Task*.
* Select the gateway and click image:quick-start/append-end-event-icon.png[width="20"] to create `EndEvent` element.
* Select the new sequence flows between elements and name them: `approved` and `rejected`.

image::getting-started/model-3.png[,400]

* Select the `approved` sequence flow and specify its *Condition* properties:
** *Condition source*: `User task outcome`
** *User task id*: `Approval`
** *User task outcome*: `approve`
+
image::getting-started/approve-condition-studio.png[,800]
+
+
* Similarly, specify *Condition* properties for the `rejected` sequence flow:
** *Condition source*: `User task outcome`
** *User task id*: `Approval`
** *User task outcome*: `reject`

image::getting-started/default-flow-studio.png[,800]

[[creating-payment-user-task]]
=== Creating Payment User Task

The other user task in our model is to notify accountants about reimbursement payment approval.
It will be represented by the xref:bpm:getting-started-testing-process.adoc#payment-form[Payment form] available only to accountants.

* Select the user task on the canvas then set its *Id* and *Name*:
** *Id*: `payment`
** *Name*: Payment

For this task, we will implement the following behavior:
it is sent to all accountants with any of them being able to claim this task.
To achieve this, instead of a particular assignee,
there is an option to specify *Candidate groups* or *Candidate users*.

Therefore, let's create a *Candidate group* for accountants.

TIP: Before leaving Modeler,
save your model as draft with image:quick-start/save-draft-button.png[width="32"] button on the toolbar.
You can open it any time later using image:quick-start/open-draft-button.png[width="32"] button.

* Go to the *BPM-> User groups* view and create a new group named `Accountants` and set `accountants` as its code.
* Set the user type to *Users*.
* Add users to the group.
+
image::quick-start/user-group.png[align="center" width="1414"]

image::getting-started/setting-candidates-studio.png[,800]

NOTE: Users involved in the processes must be granted the `BPM: process actor` role.
This role provides access to BPM views and entities required for starting processes and working with user tasks.
You can assign roles in the *Application-> Users* view.

* Go back to the modeler and select the `Payment` user task.
* Find the *Candidate groups* property field and click the edit button image:getting-started/edit-btn-studio.png[width="32"] next to it.
* In the Candidate group editor, add the `Accountants` group.
+
image::quick-start/groups.png[align="center" width="756"]

* Configure an input dialog for the `Payment` task similarly to `Approval` task.
Set the following properties:
** *Form type*: `Input dialog`
** *Open mode*: `Dialog` (this will be set by default)
* Add input parameters. They match the parameters on the Approval form, but the comment field should be non-editable too:
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Process variable | Caption | Type | Editable | Required

|`requestNumber`
|Request number
|String
|false
|true

|`expenseAmount`
|Expense amount
|Decimal (double)
|false
|true

|`expenseDate`
|Expense Date
|Date
|false
|true

|`document`
|Document
|File
|false
|true

|`comment`
|Comment
|Multiline string
|false
|false

|===
+
* Go back to the canvas and add the `EndEvent` element image:quick-start/append-end-event-icon.png[width="20"] after the `Payment` task.


[[specifying-users-to-start-process]]
=== Specifying Users to Start Process

To start a process, the user must belong to a special user group.
In our case, such a group will contain all users.

* Switch to web application.
* Open the *User groups* view and create a new group with the following properties:

** *Name*: All users
** *Code*: all-users
** *Type*: All users
+
image::quick-start/all-users.png[align="center" width="1392"]

* Go back to the *Studio Modeler* view and click anywhere on the canvas to display the process properties.
* Set *Candidate groups* to `All users` in the *Starter candidates* section.
+
image::getting-started/set-starters-studio.png[,800]

[[starting-process]]
== Deploying Process

The process model is ready to be deployed to the process engine.
Do the following steps:

* Copy draft to processes:
+
image::getting-started/copy-to-processes-studio.png[,800]

* If the application is started, use "Hot deploy" button:
+
image::getting-started/hot-deploy-studio.png[,800]

* Otherwise, run the application or start it in the debug mode:
+
image::getting-started/run-debug-buttons.png[,200]

* If the process was deployed OK, you will see a message in the console:
+
 BPMN process deployed: reimbursement.bpmn

Now you can start and test your process, go to the  xref:bpm:getting-started-testing-process.adoc[next section].
