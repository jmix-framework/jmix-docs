= Process Lifecycle

The process lifecycle in Jmix BPM encompasses the various stages that a process instance undergoes from its initiation to completion. Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for effectively managing and controlling business processes. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key stages involved in the process lifecycle:

== Modeling
The lifecycle begins with the modeling stage,
where business xref:bpm:process-artifacts.adoc#process-models[processes models] are designed and defined using BPMN 2.0 notation.
This involves creating process models that specify the flow, tasks, events, and decision points within the process.
Process models are represented in XML format.

Beyond the XML model, developers must undertake several additional tasks to create a fully executable business process:
+
* Business Logic Implementation
* User Interface (UI) Forms Creation
* Decision Tables Definition
* Event Listeners and Error Handling

== Deployment
After modeling, the process models are deployed to the process engine.
This step packages the BPMN models and resources into xref:bpm:process-artifacts.adoc#deployments[deployments]
to make them available for execution.
Deployments ensure that the xref:bpm:process-artifacts.adoc#process-definitions[process definitions]
are correctly registered within the engine.

== Instantiating
Once a process definition is deployed,
new xref:process-artifacts.adoc#process-instances[process instances] can be started.
Each instance represents a specific execution of the process and is uniquely identified.
The process instance is initialized with any necessary variables and data.

== Execution
As the process instance runs, it goes through various execution states managed by the process engine.
The engine controls the flow of execution based on the defined process model,
transitioning between tasks, events, and gateways.

== State Management
Throughout execution, the process instance can be in different states, such as running, or suspended.
The engine allows for dynamic management of these states, enabling processes to be paused or resumed as needed.

== Completion
When all tasks within a process instance are completed, the instance reaches its end state.
The engine finalizes the execution, and the instance is marked as completed.
Any associated data can be retrieved for reporting or auditing.

== Termination
In some cases, a process instance may be terminated prematurely due to errors or user intervention.
The engine provides mechanisms to handle such terminations gracefully,
ensuring that the process state remains consistent.

== History
Flowable maintains a history of process instances, capturing important events and state changes throughout the lifecycle.
This historical data is valuable for auditing, reporting, and analyzing process performance.
It allows organizations to review past executions and gain insights into process efficiency and effectiveness.
