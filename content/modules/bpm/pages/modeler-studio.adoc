= Modeler in Studio


Studio provides a *BPMN Modeler* that allows you to model business processes directly within the IDE. The designer becomes available only when the xref:bpm:index.adoc[BPM add-on] is added to the project.

== Overview

Here is a BPMN Modeler window:

The following areas and controls are present:

* *Canvas* -- A workspace where you can place BPMN elements.
* *BPMN Palette* (1) -- The BPMN palette provides a comprehensive set of elements for constructing BPMN diagrams. Located on the left side of the modeling interface, the palette enables users to easily drag and drop various BPMN elements onto the diagram canvas, facilitating intuitive and efficient process modeling.
* *Process Actions* (2) -- Located at the top left of the modeler window, the process action buttons offer options that vary depending on whether the current model is a draft or a deployable process.
* *BPMN Inspector* (4) -- This essential feature allows users to configure and manage the properties of BPMN elements within their process models.
* *Visibility Button* (5) -- This button toggles the visibility of the BPMN Inspector on and off.
== Navigate to Code

With the Modeler, you can easily navigate to the Java code associated with the properties of the selected element, allowing you to see where this code will be used.

* image:process-modeling/plus-button.png[,20] (plus) -- This button creates a new Spring bean, Java delegate, Jmix view process, or other component where code writing is necessary.
* image:process-modeling/right-button.png[,20] (chevron right) -- This button navigates to the code if the element has already been configured.
* image:process-modeling/down-button.png[,20] (chevron down) -- This button opens a dropdown list where you can select a code component to associate with the selected property.

== Property Finder

At the top of the *BPMN Inspector* panel, there is a *Find* field. By inputting the name of the property here, only the properties matching your criteria will be displayed.

For example, let's find properties with the name `id`:

Now only matched properties are displayed.

== Parameters Ordering and Deletion

When the element property may have several parameters like *Input dialog form*, the BPMN Inspector allows to move them up and down in the list.

To do this, use up (image:process-modeling/up-button.png[,20]) and down (image:process-modeling/down-button-1.png[,20]) buttons located at the top of the BPMN Navigator panel.

To delete an item from the list, use delete (image:process-modeling/delete-button.png[,20]) button.
