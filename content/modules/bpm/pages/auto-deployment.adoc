=  Automatic Deployment

BPMN processes and DMN tables can be automatically deployed on the application startup.

Use the following Flowable https://flowable.com/open-source/docs/bpmn/ch05a-Spring-Boot/#flowable-application-properties[application properties^]:

* `flowable.process-definition-location-prefix` – defines the folder in which processes need to be searched for auto deployment. 
+
Default value is `classpath*:/processes/`.
+
* `flowable.process-definition-location-suffixes` – defines the suffixes (extensions) of the files that need to be deployed from the `process-definition-location-prefix` location.
+
Default value is `pass:[*]pass:[*].bpmn20.xml,**.bpmn`.
+
* `flowable.dmn.resource-location` – defines the location where the DMN resources are located.
+
Default value is `classpath*:/dmn/`.
+
* `flowable.dmn.resource-suffixes` – defines the suffixes for the resources that need to be scanned.
+
Default value is `pass:[*]pass:[*].dmn,pass:[*]pass:[*].dmn.xml,pass:[*]pass:[*].dmn11,**.dmn11.xml`.

Only files that were modified since the last application start will be deployed.

Here is an example of locating processes and DMN resources in the derectories by default.
