= Pools and Lanes

In BPMN, a swimming pool is a graphical element used to represent a participant in a business process.

It is typically used to show the boundaries of a specific organization or department involved in the process.

A swimming pool consists of one or more lanes, which represent different roles or actors within the organization. Each lane contains the activities and tasks that are performed by that particular role or actor.

Swimming pools are useful for visually organizing and understanding complex business processes by showing the interactions between different participants and their responsibilities.

They help to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each participant and provide a clear overview of how the process flows between them.

Overall, swimming pools in BPMN help to improve communication and collaboration between different stakeholders involved in a business process.
