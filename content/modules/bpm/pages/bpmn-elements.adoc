= BPMN Elements


BPMN elements are the building blocks used to represent the various components and activities within a business process. These elements are designed to be easily understandable by all business stakeholders, including business analysts, technical developers, and business managers.


== Types of BPMN Elements

BPMN elements can be categorized into several types, each serving a specific purpose in the modeling of business processes:

1. **Flow Objects**: The main elements that define the behavior of the process.
- xref:bpmn-events.adoc[**Events**]: Represent something that happens during the process (that is, start, intermediate, end).
- **Activities**: xref:bpmn-tasks.adoc[Tasks] or xref:bpmn-subprocesses.adoc[subprocesses] that are performed (that is, user tasks, service tasks, script tasks).
- xref:bpmn-gateways.adoc[**Gateways**]: Control the flow of the process by determining branching, forking, merging, and joining of paths.

2. **Connecting Objects**: Elements that connect flow objects and define the flow of the process.
- xref:bpmn-sequence-flow.adoc[**Sequence Flows**]: Indicate the order of activities in the process.
- **Message Flows**: Show the flow of messages between different participants or processes.
- **Association**: Links artifacts to flow objects, providing additional information.

3. **Swimlanes**: Visual elements that organize the activities in a process by grouping them into different roles or responsibilities.
- xref:bpmn-pools-lanes.adoc#pools[**Pools**]: Represent major participants in a process (e.g., organizations).
- xref:bpmn-pools-lanes.adoc#lanes[**Lanes**]: Subdivisions within a pool that represent specific roles or responsibilities.

4. **Artifacts**: Additional information that can be attached to the process to provide context.
- **Data Objects**: Represent data that is required or produced by activities.
- **Groups**: Visual elements that group different tasks but do not affect the flow.
- **Annotations**: Provide additional information about the process.
