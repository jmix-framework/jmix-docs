= Testing Process

It doesn't matter where you developed the process, in Studio or in Web App.
In both cases, in the end, it must be deployed and then can be started.
Let's go through it step by step, observing all the forms we have created.

[[start-form]]
== Start Form

With the current settings, the process can be started by any user on the *BPM-> Start Process* view.

* Select the *Reimbursement* process and click the *Start process* button.

The assigned manager will then receive an incoming approval task.

[[approval-form]]
== Approval Form

Let's see how this process looks from the manager's standpoint.
On the previous step, manager *james* was assigned to approve the request.

* Log in on behalf of the manager assigned to approve the request.
* Navigate to the *BPM-> My Tasks* view.
* Select the task from the list and click the *Open Task* button.

+
* Review the request, and then click the *Approve* button.

Upon approval, the request will be sent to an accountant, who will then take care of payment.

[[payment-form]]
== Payment Form

Accountants will see reimbursements to be paid in their *Group* tasks.

* Log in on behalf of any user who is a member of the *Accountants* user group.
* Open the *BPM-> My Tasks* view. Expand the *Group tasks* node.
+

+
* Open the task form.
+

+
Fields in this form remain read-only until the task is claimed.
+
* Claim the task using one of the two options:
** Click the *Claim and resume* button to proceed with this task right away.
This will remove the task from the *Group* list and the *Complete button* will appear.
** Click *Claim and close* to claim the task while postponing its completion.
This will close the form and move the task from *Group* tasks to the current user's *Assigned* tasks list.
After that, the task is no longer visible to other accountants.
+
* Click the *Complete task* button to finish the process.
This button is added by default to any task that does not have outcomes specified.

The process is now complete.
