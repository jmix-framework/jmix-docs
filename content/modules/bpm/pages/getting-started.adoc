= Getting Started with BPM

Jmix BPM enables the creation of BPMN process models, configuration of properties for all elements,
and development of the code that implements business logic and UI forms.
These features facilitate the creation of executable process models that can be deployed to the embedded BPM server.

The add-on utilizes a visual modeler based on the https://bpmn.io/[bpmn-js^] rendering toolkit for process modeling.
It is available in two options:

* As an additional tool in Jmix Studio for use within IntelliJ IDEA.
* As a functional component of your web application, distributable without any licensing costs.

== Sample Process

Modeling processes using the *Studio Modeler* and  *Web Modeler* offer a similar experience,
as both tools feature intuitive interfaces for creating BPMN diagrams.

Next sections describe how to model and run a simple business process in both tools.
For that, we will create a process for requesting and approving reimbursement.

The process involves three participants:

* an employee who requests a reimbursement;
* a manager who approves the reimbursement;
* an accountant who processes payment upon approval.

In terms of BPM, we will be building the following model:
