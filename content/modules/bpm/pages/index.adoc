= BPM

BPM add-on is used for modeling and running business processes. Processes are described using BPMN 2.0 notation. The add-on uses https://flowable.com/open-source/[Flowable^] as a business process engine and https://bpmn.io/[bpmn-js^] rendering toolkit for process modeling.

This manual mostly describes features added by the add-on, not features provided by underlying frameworks, so you should be familiar with the Flowable engine.

== Installation

Follow the instructions in the xref:ROOT:add-ons.adoc[Add-ons] section to install the add-on into your application.
