In this section, you will learn how to build a Jmix application as executable JAR and deploy it to the link:https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/[AWS Elastic Beanstalk^] service.

Before starting the guide, create an account and ensure that you have access to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home[AWS Console^].

NOTE: We will use PostgreSQL as a database for this guide.

TIP: If you need to deploy your application just for test or demo purposes, consider using xref:studio:quick-cloud-deployment.adoc[]. It will deploy and run your application together with the database on a newly created EC2 instance.

=== Preparing The Application

Since we have more than one database connection now (local development and AWS), we need to configure additional properties file that will contain connection properties for AWS environment.

To switch between different configurations, we will use {spring-boot-doc}/reference/features/profiles.html[Runtime Profiles^]. For our case, we will use `aws` profile name.

Let's create `application-aws.properties` file according to naming rules described in {spring-boot-doc}/reference/features/external-config.html#features.external-config.files.profile-specific[Profile Specific Files].

In this file, we will specify database connection properties using AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment variables:

* `RDS_HOSTNAME` - internal Beanstalk-specific database host name
* `RDS_PORT` - database port allocated by Beanstalk
* `RDS_DB_NAME` - database name
* `RDS_USERNAME` - database username
* `RDS_PASSWORD` - database password

TIP: Note that these variables should be specified if you create a database using Beanstalk. If you created the database separately using RDS or another AWS service, you may not need these variables

In addition to the datasource coordinates, we may want to specify the following properties before the deployment:

* `server.port` - should be set to 5000 by default. You can specify Beanstalk environment property `SERVER_PORT` instead if you like. We will show how to set Beanstalk environment later.
* `main.liquibase.enabled` - if set to `true` (default value) - enables automatic execution of Liquibase database migration scripts on application start.

So, the `application-aws.properties` file content may look like this:

[source,properties,indent=0]
main.datasource.url = jdbc:postgresql://${RDS_HOSTNAME}:${RDS_PORT}/${RDS_DB_NAME}
main.datasource.username = ${RDS_USERNAME}
main.datasource.password = ${RDS_PASSWORD}
server.port=5000

The application is ready, you can create an executable JAR and move to the next step.

[[create-aws-env]]
=== Creating The AWS environment

Log in to the AWS Console and select *Elastic Beanstalk* service from the list of services.

After that, create the application by clicking on a corresponding link on the Beanstalk main page. Enter application information:

* Application name - any name you prefer.
* Platform - Java. Select platform branch according to your preferences.

In the *Application code* section select *Upload your code* option. In the *Source code origin* section for the *Local file* option click on *Choose file* button and upload your application's JAR. It is usually located in `/build/libs` folder.

Add a database to the environment by clicking on *Configure more options* button. In the configuration page, edit the database parameters:

Set database parameters similar to those on the picture:

image::aws-rds-parameters.png[align=center]

TIP: Setting *Retention* to `Delete` is recommended for test environments. For production environments set it to `Create snapshot` to avoid data loss in case of the application is deleted accidentally.

After creating the database, we have one more step specifying runtime profile to enable proper application configuration - `aws`. In order to do this, edit *Software* settings in the environment configuration page:

image::aws-ebs-environment-settings.png[align=center]

In the *Environment properties* section add the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` property and set its value to `aws`:

image::aws-ebs-environment-values.png[align=center]

Save all settings and create the application. The creation and startup usually takes 5-10 minutes.

[[test]]
=== Testing The Deploy

When the application is created and deployed, open the environments list and click on the corresponding environment:

image:aws-ebs-app-env-list.png[align=center]

In the environment page, click on the *Go to environment* link to open the deployed application page.

image:aws-ebs-app-env-page.png[align=center]

The application page should open.
