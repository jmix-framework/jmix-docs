= 2. Calendar Navigation

Users require the ability to navigate to previous and subsequent dates or to a specific time within time-grid calendar display modes. This functionality is currently missing.

[[date-navigation]]
== Date Navigation

`FullCalendar` provides methods for navigating forward and backward. The navigation "step" (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) is determined by the current calendar display mode.

First, add navigation buttons above the calendar in the *MyCalendar* view:

include::example$fullcalendar-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/mycalendar/my-calendar.xml[tags=onboarding-calendar-navigation1]
----

Next, implement calendar navigation using these steps:

* Inject the `FullCalendar` component.
* Subscribe to the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/button.adoc#ClickEvent[ClickEvent] for the `previousButton`
* Subscribe to the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/button.adoc#ClickEvent[ClickEvent] for the `nextButton`

We will use the following methods of the `FullCalendar` component:

* `navigateToPrevious()`.
* `navigateToNext()`.

As a result, users will be able to navigate to the next and previous months.

[[time-scrolling]]
== Time Scrolling

By default, the `FullCalendar` component displays the month display mode, which may be redundant due to the small number of events, plus it does not show the time grid. Let's change the initial calendar display mode and set up the time to which the component should scroll initially.

The `scrollTime` attribute accepts a string in ISO-8601 duration format (as used by the `java.time.Duration` class). For instance:

* `"P1d"` - 1 day.
* `"PT1h"` - 1 hour.
* `"PT30m"` - 30 minutes.
* `"P1dT1h30m"` - 1 day plus 1 hour and 30 minutes.
