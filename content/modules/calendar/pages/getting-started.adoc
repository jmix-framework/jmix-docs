[[about-app]]
== About the Sample Application

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll introduce a new feature to the Onboarding application.

In the Onboarding application, upon successful completion of all onboarding tasks by an employee, the application automatically creates a new meeting event. This event is then displayed in the employee's `MyCalendar` view.

=== Data Model

The original data model of the Onboarding application looks as follows:

To achieve new application behavior, you will need to slightly modify the model by adding a new JPA entity called `Meeting`. The `Meeting` entity will be related to the `User`.
