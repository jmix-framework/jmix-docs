= Getting Started with Calendar

This tutorial provides instructions on getting started with integrating Calendar into your application.

You will use the Onboarding application created in the xref:tutorial:index.adoc[Tutorial] section as a starting point. You can download the complete source code of this application from the https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2[jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2^] GitHub repository.

The original data model of the Onboarding application looks as follows:

In the Onboarding application, when the employee completes all onboarding tasks, the application must create a `Meeting` event. This event will be shown in the `MyCalendar` view.

To achieve this application behavior, you will need to slightly modify the model by adding a new JPA entity called Meeting. The Meeting entity will be related to the User.
