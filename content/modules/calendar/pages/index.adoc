The Calendar add-on provides seamless integration with the https://fullcalendar.io/[FullCalendar] JavaScript component, a popular library for building interactive calendars.

This add-on includes a `FullCalendar` component that allows you to display events within a calendar using different display modes (day, week, month, etc.). Users can then interact with these events by:

* *Dragging*: Moving events to different dates or times within the calendar.
* *Resizing*: Adjusting the duration of an event by dragging its edges.
