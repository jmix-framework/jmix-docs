[[basic]]
== Basic

The `FullCalendar` component is available in the *Add Component* palette of the Studio xref:studio:view-designer.adoc[View Designer] as soon as you install add-on in your project.

image::add-calendar-via-studio.png[align="center"; width="765"]

The new `calendar:calendar` element will be added in both the *Jmix UI* structure panel and in the XML. You can configure attributes like xref:flow-ui:vc/common-attributes.adoc#id[id], xref:flow-ui:vc/common-attributes.adoc#height[height], xref:flow-ui:vc/common-attributes.adoc#width[width], etc., in the same way as it is done for other xref:flow-ui:vc/components.adoc[UI components].

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<calendar:calendar id="calendar"
                   height="100%"
                   width="100%"/>
----

If you don’t use the view designer, declare the `calendar` namespace in your view’s XML descriptor manually:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<view xmlns="http://jmix.io/schema/flowui/view"
      xmlns:calendar="http://jmix.io/schema/fullcalendar/ui"
      title="Calendar view">
----

If you need to show events, bind `containerEventProvider` to xref:flow-ui:data/data-containers.adoc[data container].

The following example demonstrates how a basic `calendar` is created:

[[data-model]]
== Data Model

[[calendar-event]]
=== CalendarEvent

The base interface for events within the `FullCalendar` component is `CalendarEvent`. It provides a common set of properties for representing events. These properties are used for displaying and managing events within the calendar.

[cols="1h,6a",grid=none]
|===
|[[id]]id
|A unique identifier for the calendar event. It is used for identification on the client side.

|[[groupId]]groupId
|The group object that is shared among other events. Events with the same group ID will be dragged and resized together automatically.

|[[allDay]]allDay
|Determines whether event is shown in the 'all-day' section of the relevant <<calendar-display-modes,display mode>>. By default, the component considers all events as non-all-day.

A `null` value means that the event is not an all-day event.

|[[startDateTime]]startDateTime
|Defines the start date-time position of the event. It is of type `LocalDateTime` and should correspond to the system's default time zone. For <<EntityCalendarEvent>>, the value will be automatically converted from the supported date-time data type.

|[[endDateTime]]endDateTime
|Defines the end date-time position of the event. It is of type `LocalDateTime` and should correspond to the system's default time zone. For <<EntityCalendarEvent>>, the value will be automatically converted from the supported date-time data type.

This value is *exclusive*. For instance, an event with an end date-time property of `2024-09-03` will appear to span through `2024-09-02` but will not extend into the start of `2024-09-03`.

|[[title]]title
|The text that will appear on the event.

|[[description]]description
|The text of the event description.

|[[interactive]]interactive
|Specifies whether events can be navigated using the TAB key.

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage event interactivity based on the <<eventInteractive, eventInteractive>> property.

|[[classNames]]classNames
|Specifies the class names, separated by spaces, that should be attached to the rendered event.

|[[startEditable]]startEditable
|Determines whether an event can be dragged within the calendar component.

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage the event's draggable feature based on the <<eventStartEditable, eventStartEditable>> property.

|[[durationEditable]]durationEditable
|Determines whether an event can be resized within the calendar component.

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage the event's resizable feature based on the <<eventDurationEditable, eventDurationEditable>> property.

|[[display]]display
|Defines the type of event rendering. If not specified, the `AUTO` value will be used.

|[[overlap]]overlap
|Defines whether the event can be dragged or resized over other events. It also prevents other events from being dragged or resized over this event.

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage this feature based on the <<eventOverlap, eventOverlap>> property or a specific JavaScript function.

|[[constraint]]constraint
|Defines a shared group identifier. This property limits dragging and resizing to specific cells within the component.

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage the event's constraint based on the <<eventConstraintGroupId, eventConstraintGroupId>> or <<eventConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled, eventConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled>> properties.

|[[backgroundColor]]backgroundColor
|Specifies the background color for the event. Supported values include:

* Hexadecimal color codes (for example, `#f00`, `#ff0000`)
* RGB color values (for example, `rgb(255,0,0)`)
* Color names (for example, `red`)

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage the event's background color based on the <<eventBackgroundColor, eventBackgroundColor>> property.

|[[borderColor]]borderColor
|Specifies the border color for the event. Supported values include:

* Hexadecimal color codes (for example, `#f00`, `#ff0000`)
* RGB color values (for example, `rgb(255,0,0)`)
* Color names (for example, `red`)

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage the event's border color based on the <<eventBorderColor, eventBorderColor>> property.

|[[textColor]]textColor
|Specifies the text color for the event. Supported values include:

* Hexadecimal color codes (for example, `#f00`, `#ff0000`)
* RGB color values (for example, `rgb(255,0,0)`)
* Color names (for example, `red`)

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage the event's text color based on the <<eventTextColor, eventTextColor>> property.

|[[additionalProperties]]additionalProperties
|Defines additional properties and their values that will be available in various JavaScript functions that take an event as a parameter.

|[[recurringDaysOfWeek]]recurringDaysOfWeek
|Specifies the days of the week on which this event repeats. If omitted, the event is assumed to repeat every day.

|[[recurringStartDate]]recurringStartDate
|Specifies the date when the recurrences of this event start. If not specified, the recurrences will extend infinitely into the past.

|[[recurringEndDate]]recurringEndDate
|Specifies the date when the recurrences of this event end. If not specified, the recurrences will extend infinitely into the future.

Note that this value is *exclusive*. For all-day recurring events, set the end date to the day after your desired last recurrence.

|[[recurringStartTime]]recurringStartTime
|Specifies the start time of a recurring event. If this is not defined, the event is considered an all-day event.

Note that the calendar does not apply time zone conversion for this property. If the `OffsetTime` datatype is used in the entity, it will be transformed to the system's default time zone.

|[[recurringEndTime]]recurringEndTime
|Specifies the end time of a recurring event. If this is not defined, the event will to have the default duration as configured by the <<defaultTimedEventDuration, defaultTimedEventDuration>> property.
|===

[[entity-calendar-event]]
=== EntityCalendarEvent

The implementation of <<calendar-event, CalendarEvent>> that works with JPA entities or DTOs.
When <<container-data-provider>> is linked to a xref:flow-ui:data/collection-container.adoc[collection container], it automatically wraps loaded entities in `EntityCalendarEvent` objects and pass them to the component.
For example,  all calendar events in this scenario would be instances of `EntityCalendarEvent`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/sample-entity-calendar-event.xml[tags=sample-entity-calendar-event1]
----

And you can safely cast to `EntityCalendarEvent`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/SampleEntityCalendarEvent.java[tags=sample-entity-calendar-event2]

    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-simple-calendar-event" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

The simple POJO class that implements the <<calendar-event, CalendarEvent>> interface.
You can use this event class as an alternative to creating DTOs or for prototyping purposes.
It also includes a builder class to simplify the creation of event instances.

[[recurring-events]]
=== Recurring Events

++++
<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-recurring-events" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

Recurring events are events that occur multiple times at regular intervals, following a predefined schedule.

In `FullCalendar`, you can configure this schedule using the following properties within `CalendarEvent`:

- <<recurringDaysOfWeek, recurringDaysOfWeek>>
- <<recurringStartDate, recurringStartDate>>
- <<recurringEndDate, recurringEndDate>>
- <<recurringStartTime, recurringStartTime>>
- <<recurringEndTime, recurringEndTime>>

If any of these recurrence properties are specified, `FullCalendar` assumes the event is recurring and ignores the <<startDateTime, startDateTime>> and <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> properties.

When the data provider specifies recurrence properties, the single repeating event in the container will be expanded into individual events instances with their own dates in `FullCalendar`.
However, the container will still contain the single recurring event.

You can specify recurrence properties in the data provider as shown below:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/sample-recurring-events-view.xml[tags=sample-recurring-events1]
----

[[recurrence-event-and-group-id]]
==== Managing Recurring Events in FullCalendar

`FullCalendar` expands single recurring events into individual events instances.
These instances are treated as independent events, meaning changes to one instance won't affect others by default.

*Example: Moving Recurring Events*

Let's say you have a recurring meeting that happens every Tuesday. If you enable the <<eventStartEditable, eventStartEditable>> property, a user can drag and move a specific instance of that meeting (for example, the meeting on November 7th) to a different time slot. However, this change will only affect the November 7th instance. The meetings on other Tuesdays will remain at their original times.

*Grouping Recurring Events*

To move all instances of a recurring event together, you need to group them using the <<groupId, groupId>> property of <<calendar-event, CalendarEvent>>.

Here's how it works:

. *Assign a Group ID*: Set the same `groupId` value to all instances of the recurring event you want to move together.
. *Enable Dragging*: Ensure the `eventStartEditable` property is set to true to allow dragging.

Now, when a user drags an instance of the recurring event, all instances within that group will move simultaneously, maintaining the defined recurrence pattern.

[[days-of-week-datatype]]
==== DaysOfWeek Datatype

The <<recurringDaysOfWeek, recurringDaysOfWeek>> property defines the list of days of the week. In order to store this data in JPA entities or DTOs, Jmix provides a dedicated data type called `DaysOfWeek`.

The Studio automatically provides this data type when you add an attribute to a JPA entity or DTO. You can then select the desired days of the week for your recurring event.

image::add-recurring-days-of-week-attribute.png[align="center",width="871"]

The `DaysOfWeek` data type is supported by both the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/valuePicker.adoc[] component and the `DaysOfWeekEditAction`. This allows you to easily edit the list of days of the week in your user interface.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/app/event/event-detail-view.xml[tags=sample-days-of-week-edit-action]
----

[[data-binding]]
== Data Binding

The calendar component uses data providers to connect loaded data and display it visually. To be visible in the component, a data item must implement the <<calendar-event, CalendarEvent>> interface. For JPA or DTO entities, a <<container-data-provider>> wraps the entity to create an <<EntityCalendarEvent>>.

The `FullCalendar` component allows you to add multiple data providers.
This allows you to display data from different data sources and services within a single calendar.

[[calendar-data-provider]]
=== CalendarDataProvider

`CalendarDataProvider` is a base interface for all data providers used by the calendar.
There are two main types of calendar data providers:

* Data providers that load all data at once. These providers retrieve all relevant data in a single operation.
* <<CallbackCalendarDataProvider>>. These providers load data on demand, using a callback mechanism to retrieve partial data as needed.

[[container-data-provider]]
=== ContainerDataProvider

++++
<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-container-calendar-data-provider" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

The `ContainerDataProvider` works with xref:flow-ui:data/data-containers.adoc[].
It reflects any changes made to the container (adding, removing, or modifying entities) and updates the `FullCalendar` UI accordingly.

To use the container data provider in `FullCalendar`, you should specify:

* `dataContainer` property: a reference to an ID of an existing container in your view.
* Entity properties mapping.
The container data provider wraps JPA or DTO entities into <<entity-calendar-event>> to make them compatible with the `FullCalendar` component. However, it doesn't automatically know which properties from the JPA or DTO entity should be used for the <<calendar-event>>. Therefore, you must define property mappings to specify which entity properties correspond to specific `CalendarEvent` properties.

Here is an example of using the `ContainerDataProvider`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/sample-container-calendar-data-provider-view.xml[tags=sample-container-calendar-data-provider1]
----

To work with the container data provider programmatically, you can use the `ContainerCalendarDataProvider` class.

[[list-calendar-data-provider]]
=== ListCalendarDataProvider

++++
<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-list-calendar-data-provider" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

The `ListCalendarDataProvider` retrieves data from a provided list of items. It doesn't require an XML definition and can be added programmatically.

Here's a basic example of using a `ListCalendarDataProvider`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/SampleListCalendarDataProviderView.java[tags=sample-list-calendar-data-provider1]
----

The list data provider automatically updates the `FullCalendar` UI when its data is modified through its API methods:

* `addItem()`: adds an item to the UI.
* `removeItem()`: removes an item from the UI.
* `updateItem()`: updates an item in the UI.

`ListDataProvider` also provides other methods for managing the list of items.

[[callback-calendar-data-provider]]
=== CallbackCalendarDataProvider

++++
<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-callback-calendar-data-provider" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

The `CallbackCalendarDataProvider` is a base interface for data providers that load data on demand.
This interface defines a method called `onItemsFetch()` that is invoked whenever the component needs new data.

Data is loaded in the following situations:

* When the user switches to a calendar display mode with a wider date range than the previous one. For example, if the user changes from a daily view to a weekly view, the component will need to fetch data for the entire week.
* When the navigation methods of the `FullCalendar` component are invoked. This includes methods like `navigateToNext()`, `navigateToPrevious()`, and other methods that move the calendar view forward or backward in time.
* When the time zone of the `FullCalendar` component is changed. The component will need to fetch new data to reflect the updated time zone.

[[callback-data-provider]]
=== CallbackDataProvider

The data provider that loads data using a JPQL query and a xref:data-access:data-manager.adoc[DataManager].
Similar to <<container-data-provider>>, it requires you to define property mappings to specify how entity properties map to `CalendarEvent` properties.
Additionally, you must provide a JPQL query that defines the data to be loaded.

Here's an example of property mappings within the `callbackDataProvider` element:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/sample-entity-calendar-data-retriever-view.xml[tags=sample-entity-calendar-data-retriever1]
----

To load data using a JPQL query, you should specify an <<items-query-element>> element within the data provider.
This element requires the fully qualified name of the entity class used in the JPQL query.

The items query allows you to define a xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#fetch-plan[FetchPlan] in the `fetchPlan` attribute or within a separate `fetchPlan` element.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/sample-entity-calendar-data-retriever-view.xml[tags=sample-entity-calendar-data-retriever2]
----

In the JPQL query you can use two parameters:

- `fetchStartDate` - the left border of visible date range in the `FullCalendar`
- `fetchEndDate` - the right border of visible date range in the `FullCalendar`.

NOTE: The `fetchEndDate` value is exclusive.
For instance, if the visible date range is from `2024-09-29` to `2024-11-09` the actual value of the `fetchEndDate` will be `2024-11-10`.

The full example of using `callbackDataProvider`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/sample-entity-calendar-data-retriever-view.xml[tags=sample-entity-calendar-data-retriever10]
----

NOTE: This JPQL query assumes that the `startDate` and `endDate` values are not `null`.
If they might be `null`, you'll need to add a `null` check to the query.

To work programmatically with the callback data provider, use the `EntityCalendarDataRetriever` class.
This class is a Spring bean with prototype scope, so you should initialize it carefully using Spring's dependency injection mechanisms.

[[callback-data-provider-and-load-delegate]]
==== CallbackDataProvider and Load Delegate

++++
<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-callback-load-delegate" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

In situations where complex business logic requires building intricate JPQL queries with numerous conditions, writing the query directly in an XML descriptor can become cumbersome. To address this, you can set a load delegate for the `CallbackDataProvider`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/SampleEntityCalendarDataRetrieverView.java[tags=sample-entity-calendar-data-retriever4]
----

TIP: `myDataProvider` is the ID of the data provider. You can specify it using the `id` attribute in the XML definition.

NOTE: If your implementation of the load delegate returns a list of <<entity-calendar-event>>, you will need to specify property mappings within the data provider.

[[calendar-data-retriever]]
=== CalendarDataRetriever

++++
<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-calendar-data-retriever" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

The `CalendarDataRetriever` is a simple data provider that is similar to the `callbackDataProvider` with a load delegate. However, it lacks an XML definition. This data provider can be used in conjunction with services to load data, providing a more flexible and programmatic approach to data management within the calendar component.

[source,java,indent=0]

[[calendar-display-modes]]
== Calendar Display Modes

</div>
++++

In `FullCalendar`, a display mode represents a specific way of visualizing calendar data. It allows users to view events across different timeframes, like days, weeks, or months. This flexibility helps users interact with the calendar in various formats, depending on their needs. For example, you might prefer a detailed view of a single day or a broader overview of an entire month.

`FullCalendar` provides a range of built-in display modes:

[[day-grid-modes]]
* **Day-grid modes** display calendar events in a grid format, similar to traditional paper calendars. Each cell within the day-grid represents a single day.
[[dayGridDay]]
** `DAY_GRID_DAY` - focuses on a single day, offering a detailed view of events scheduled for that specific day.
[[dayGridWeek]]
** `DAY_GRID_WEEK` - a full week's worth of days, ideal for focusing on upcoming events.
[[dayGridMonth]]
** `DAY_GRID_MONTH` - displays an entire month at a glance, enabling users to see all days and their associated events.
[[dayGridYear]]
** `DAY_GRID_YEAR` - presents an entire year, providing a high-level overview.
+
You can use the <<initialDisplayMode, initialDisplayMode>> attribute to set the initial day-grid mode for your `FullCalendar` instance:

The screenshot below demonstrates a day-grid month display mode:
+
image::day-grid-month-mode.png[align="center",width="1371"]

[[time-grid-modes]]
* *Time-grid modes* offer time-oriented layouts for displaying events across one or more days. These formats are especially useful for users who need to manage their schedules with a strong focus on specific times throughout the day.
+
`FullCalendar` provides two time-grid modes:
+
[[timeGridDay]]
** `TIME_GRID_DAY` - displays a single day in detail, allowing users to see all events scheduled for that day along with their specific start and end times.
[[timeGridWeek]]
** `TIME_GRID_WEEK` - shows an entire week, providing a broader view while still maintaining the time slots for each day. This mode is ideal for visualizing weekly schedules or planning meetings across multiple days.
+
You can use the <<initialDisplayMode, initialDisplayMode>> attribute to set the initial time-grid mode for your `FullCalendar` instance:

[[list-modes]]
* *List modes* present events in a straightforward vertical format, making it easy for users to view and manage their schedules over a specified period. This layout is ideal for users who prefer a simple, text-based representation of their events.
+
`FullCalendar` offers various list modes:
+
[[listDay]]
** `LIST_DAY` - displays all events for a single day.
[[listWeek]]
** `LIST_WEEK` - displays events for an entire week.
[[listMonth]]
** `LIST_MONTH` - lists events for the entire month.
[[listYear]]

=== Display Mode Properties

<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-display-mode-specific-properties" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

Each predefined display mode has its own set of properties. Some properties are specific to a particular display mode, while others are general.

For example, you can configure `dayHeaderFormat` only for the day-grid day mode, and other modes won't affect its format.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/displaymode/display-mode-properties-view.xml[tags=display-mode-properties1]
----

`FullCalendar` also allows you to override properties in the calendar component using properties configured from the display mode.

For instance, imagine the component enables the <<weekNumbersVisible, weekNumbersVisible>> property. However, if you need to disable this feature for the day-grid month display mode, you should use the `properties` tag within the display mode properties.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/displaymode/display-mode-properties-override-view.xml[tags=display-mode-properties-override1]
----

NOTE: In the `name` attribute, you should specify the property name as it is defined in `FullCalendar.js`.
Refer to the https://fullcalendar.io/docs#toc[FullCalendar.js documentation^] to find the correct property name.
Use this feature carefully; `FullCalendar` might ignore this display mode property setup if you change the same property in the component at runtime.

[[custom-calendar-display-mode]]
=== Custom Calendar Display Mode

++++
<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-custom-calendar-display-mode" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

If the predefined display modes don't meet your needs, you can create your own custom display mode with a specific date range. There are two ways to create a custom display mode:

* *Programmatically*, using the `CustomCalendarDisplayMode` class.
* *Declaratively*, using the <<custom-display-modes-element,customDisplayModes>> element in an XML.

Custom display modes should be based on one of four base types: day-grid, time-grid, list, and multi-month.

For example, you can define a time-oriented display mode declaratively using the following code:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/displaymode/custom-display-mode-view.xml[tags=custom-display-mode1]
----

NOTE: The `dayCount` attribute sets the exact number of days displayed in a custom display mode, regardless of the <<weekendsVisible, weekendsVisible>> or <<hidden-days-element, hiddenDays>> properties.

You can also use the `duration` element instead of the `dayCount` attribute to specify the date range:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/displaymode/custom-display-mode-view.xml[tags=custom-display-mode2]
----

NOTE: When a date range is specified using `duration`, hidden days will be omitted, and the display mode will stretch to fill the missing space.
However, if you specify `dayCount`, you are guaranteed to see a specific number of days.

For programmatic creation of custom display modes, use `CustomCalendarDisplayMode`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/displaymode/CustomDisplayModeView.java[tags=custom-display-mode3]
----

TIP: The default display mode is the day grid, but you can customize it by choosing a different type from the `GenericCalendarDisplayModes` enumeration.

[[display-mode-and-visible-range]]
=== Display Mode and Visible Range

++++
<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-generic-calendar-display-modes" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

You can further customize the date range displayed in a calendar by using the `visibleRange` property. This property should be used in conjunction with the options from the `GenericCalendarDisplayModes` enumeration.

It's important to note that `visibleRange` does not have an XML definition and can only be configured programmatically.

For example, you can configure the calendar to display the day grid like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/displaymode/visible-range-view.xml[tags=visible-range1]
----

TIP: The `GenericCalendarDisplayModes` enum provides the following display options in XML: `DAY_GRID`, `TIME_GRID`, `LIST`, and `MULTI_MONTH`.

Set the required visible range in the view controller:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/displaymode/VisibleRangeView.java[tags=visible-range2]
----

NOTE: The last date is exclusive.
For example, a visible range of October 1, 2024, to October 3, 2024, will display only two days (October 1st and 2nd).

NOTE: When a visible range is set, navigation methods like `navigateToNext()` will not function.

[[calendar-event-editing]]
== Calendar Event Editing

`FullCalendar` lets you edit calendar events by dragging and dropping to change the start date, and resizing to adjust the duration. To handle these changes, you should add the following event listeners: <<EventDropEvent, EventDropEvent>> and <<EventResizeEvent, EventResizeEvent>>.

The component can modify only three properties of the <<calendar-event, CalendarEvent>> based on event changes:

* <<startDateTime, startDateTime>>
* <<endDateTime, endDateTime>>
* <<allDay, allDay>>

[[drag-and-drop]]
=== Drag and Drop

<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-event-start-editable" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

To enable the drag and drop feature, set the <<eventStartEditable, eventStartEditable>> property to `true`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/eventedit/event-edit-code-samples-view.xml[tags=event-edit-drag-and-drop1]
----

[[event-drop-event]]
==== Event Drop Event

To handle changes when a calendar event is dropped, subscribe to the <<EventDropEvent, EventDropEvent>>.
This event is emitted by the `FullCalendar` component when a user moves a calendar event to a different position.

NOTE: Before proceeding with an event to the listeners, the component applies changes to the calendar event in the data provider.

The event contains the following information:

* The dropped calendar event
* The calendar event's data provider
* Old values
* Information about the current display mode
* The delta (duration) between the old start date and the new start date
* Related calendar events that were also dropped with the dropped calendar event

The example below demonstrates how to immediately save changes to an entity calendar event:

[source,java,indent=0]

    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-event-duration-editable" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

To enable calendar event resizing, set the <<eventDurationEditable, eventDurationEditable>> property to `true`. This allows users to change the duration (size) of a calendar event by modifying its end date.

To resize the calendar event by modifying its start date, set the <<eventResizableFromStart, eventResizableFromStart>> property to `true`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/eventedit/event-edit-code-samples-view.xml[tags=event-edit-resizable1]
----

[[event-resize-event]]
==== Event Resize Event

To handle changes when a calendar event is resized, subscribe to the <<EventResizeEvent, EventResizeEvent>>.
This event is triggered by the `FullCalendar` component when a user resizes a calendar event.

NOTE: Before proceeding with an event to the listeners, the component applies changes to the calendar event in the data provider.

The event contains the following information:

* The resized calendar event
* The calendar event's data provider
* Old values
* Information about the current display mode
* The start delta (duration) between the old start date and the new start date
* The end delta (duration) between the old end date and the new old date
* Related calendar events that were also resized with the dropped calendar event

The example below demonstrates how to immediately save changes to an entity calendar event:

[source,java,indent=0]

<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-event-constraint" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

`FullCalendar` allows you to configure limitations for dragging and resizing events.
You can restrict event changes in three ways:

* *Event Constraint Group ID*:
+
Set an <<eventConstraintGroupId, eventConstraintGroupId>> value. If this property is set, events that are being dragged or resized must be fully contained within at least one of the events linked to the specified group ID.

* *Default Business Hours*:
+
Enable the default business hours using the <<eventConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled, eventConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled>> property. Events that are being dragged or resized must be fully contained within the week’s business hours.
If <<defaultBusinessHoursEnabled, defaultBusinessHoursEnabled>> is set, the default business hours are Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM. Custom business hours are also respected.

* *Custom Business Hours*:
+
Set custom business hours. As with the default business hours, events must be contained within the defined custom business hours.

[[event-overlap]]
=== Event Overlap

++++
<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-event-overlap-function" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

The <<eventOverlap, eventOverlap>> attribute provides another way to limit dragging and resizing calendar events. It controls whether events can overlap each other while being dragged or resized. By default, overlapping is enabled.

For more granular control, you can use a JavaScript function to define custom overlap rules.

The following example demonstrates how to allow all-day calendar events to overlap only with other all-day events:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/eventedit/EventOverlapView.java[tags=event-edit-event-overlap1]
----

NOTE: The JavaScript function definition for event overlap takes precedence over the <<eventOverlap, eventOverlap>> property.

TIP: You can access all available properties of events in the https://fullcalendar.io/docs/event-object[FullCalendar.js documentation^]. Within the JavaScript function, you can utilize <<additionalProperties, additionalProperties>> available under the `extendedProps` object of an event. For example, if a calendar event has an additional property called `myEventStatus`, you can retrieve its value like this: `stillEvent.extendedProps.myEventStatus`.

[[selection]]
== Selection

<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-selection" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

The selection feature in `FullCalendar` allows users to select multiple days or time slots by clicking or dragging their mouse. To enable this feature, set the <<selectionEnabled, selectionEnabled>> property to `true`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/selection/selection-code-samples-view.xml[tags=selection-basic1]
----

[[select-event]]
=== Select Event

To handle selection events, subscribe to the <<SelectEvent, SelectEvent>>.
This event is triggered by the `FullCalendar` component when a user selects multiple days or time slots.

The event contains the following information:

* The start date and time.
* The end date and time.
* The `allDay` property. Indicates whether the selected dates are day cells or time slots.
* Information about the current display mode.
* Information about the mouse click.

The example of subscribing to select event:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/selection/SelectionSelectEventView.java[tags=selection-select-event1]
----

NOTE: The end date and time are *exclusive*. For example, if the selection is all-day and the last date value is `2024-10-15`, the value of the end date property will be `2024-10-16`.

[[unselect-event]]
=== Unselect Event

To handle the clearing of a selection, subscribe to the <<UnselectEvent, UnselectEvent>>.
This event is triggered by the `FullCalendar` component when a selection is cleared.
It is fired in the following cases:

* User clicks away from the current selection: This happens unless the <<unselectAuto, unselectAuto>> property is disabled.
* User makes a new selection: The event is fired before the new selection occurs.
* User moves forward or backward in the calendar view or switches to a different mode.
* The `unselect()` method is called.

The event contains the following information:

* Information about the current display mode.
* Information about the mouse click.

The example of subscribing to unselect event:

----

[[select-constraints]]
=== Select Constraints

Selection constraints in `FullCalendar` are similar to <<calendar-event-constraints>>, but they apply to the selection area. These constraints limit the selectable area based on the following options:

* The <<selectConstraintGroupId, selectConstraintGroupId>> property: if this property is set, only dates or time slots containing events with the specified group ID can be selected.
* The <<selectConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled, selectConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled>> property: the selection can only be made within the week's business hours. If <<defaultBusinessHoursEnabled, defaultBusinessHoursEnabled>> is set, the default business hours are Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM. Custom business hours are also respected.
* Custom business hours: as with the default business hours, selections must be made within the custom business hours.

[[select-overlap]]
=== Select Overlap

++++
<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-select-overlap-function" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

The <<selectOverlap, selectOverlap>> attribute provides another way to limit selection in `FullCalendar`. It controls whether the selection area can overlap with existing calendar events. By default, overlap is allowed.

For more fine-grained control, you can use a JavaScript function definition to check whether a selection can overlap with a calendar event.

The following example demonstrates how to allow selection in cells that contain background calendar events:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/selection/SelectionSelectOverlapView.java[tags=selection-select-overlap1]

NOTE: The JavaScript function definition for selection overlap takes precedence over the <<selectOverlap, selectOverlap>> property.

TIP: You can find all available properties of events in the https://fullcalendar.io/docs/event-object[FullCalendar.js documentation^].
Within the JavaScript function, you can utilize <<additionalProperties, additionalProperties>> available under the `extendedProps` object of an event.
For example, if a calendar event has an additional property called `myEventStatus`, you can retrieve its value like this: `event.extendedProps.myEventStatus`.

[[programmatic-selection-control]]
=== Programmatic Selection Control

`FullCalendar` provides the following methods for programmatically selecting or unselecting a date range:

* `select()`: Selects a date range.
* `unselect()`: Clears the current selection.

The following code selects a date range of two days, including the current day:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/selection/SelectionProgrammaticSelectionControlView.java[tags=selection-programmatic-selection-control1]
----

NOTE: The end date in the example above is *excluded*, effectively selecting the current and next days.

[[control-selection-by-a-javascript-function]]
==== Controlling Selection with a JavaScript Function

You can control selection behavior for each cell using a JavaScript function. For example, the following function enables selection only for yesterday, today, and tomorrow:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/selection/SelectionSelectAllowFunctionView.java[tags=selection-select-allow-function1]
----
<1> The `selectionInfo` parameter in this function contains the following properties:
* `allDay`: A Boolean indicating whether the selection is in all-day cells.
* `end`: A Date object representing the end date of the selection (exclusive).
* `endStr`: A String representation of the end date.
* `start`: A Date object representing the start date of the selection.
* `startStr`: A String representation of the start date.

<2> The `start` and `end` dates are applicable to the selection.
<3> This method converts `LocalDate` to ISO format with the component’s time zone.

[[business-hours]]
== Business Hours

++++
<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-business-hours" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

Business hours define the specific times during which calendar events can be scheduled or displayed. There are two ways to configure business hours in the `FullCalendar` component:

* The <<defaultBusinessHoursEnabled, defaultBusinessHoursEnabled>> property.
* Custom list of business hours definitions. Allows you to specify custom business hours, overriding the defaults.

Here is an example of how to configure business hours with the `defaultBusinessHoursEnabled` property:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/businesshours/business-hours-code-samples-view.xml[tags=business-hours-code-samples1]
----

When business hours are defined, they are visually emphasized on the calendar.

image::business-hours-enabled.png[align="center",width="878"]

For more fine-grained control over business hours, you can set a list of custom business hours. This allows you to configure different hours for different days of the week or even split hours into segments (like morning and afternoon shifts).

Let's set up a duty schedule as an example. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, work hours are from 8 AM to 12 PM, while on Tuesday and Thursday, they are from 12 PM to 6 PM:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/businesshours/business-hours-code-samples-view.xml[tags=business-hours-code-samples2]
----

NOTE: The `startTime` and `endTime` properties follow the ISO-8601 duration format, which is the same format used by the `java.time.Duration` class.

image::business-hours-custom.png[align="center",width="1048"]

[[context-menu]]

<div class="jmix-ui-live-demo-container">
    <a href="https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples/sample/calendar-context-menu" class="live-demo-btn" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a>
</div>
++++

The `FullCalendar` component provides a context menu through the `FullCalendarContextMenu` class.
You can customize the content of this menu based on the clicked day cell or calendar event.

However, there are limitations on where the context menu can be opened:

* *Calendar Events*: Available in all display modes.
* *Day Cells*: Available in all day-grid display modes and the multi-month year mode.
* *Time Slots*: Not available.

The example of dynamic context menu handling:

<2> Sets the context menu handler, allowing you to configure the menu items.
<3> Removes all menu items that were previously in the context menu.

</div>
++++

You can style the calendar and its events with CSS.
Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the DOM tree of the calendar and write CSS selectors.

For example, the following selectors change the background color of Saturday and Sunday in day-grid modes:

[source,css,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/frontend/themes/fullcalendar-sample/styling-css-samples.css[tags=styling-css1]

[[component-and-event-properties]]
=== Component and Event Properties

The `FullCalendar` component and calendar events have properties that define event colors.

For instance, the following example sets colors for all calendar events:

Refer to the <<Handlers>> section for a complete list of class name generators.

[[localization]]
== Localization

Localization can be changed locally for a single `FullCalendar` component or globally using the `messages` mechanism.

To configure the localization of a single component, use component properties and the `FullCalendarI18n` object.
The `FullCalendarI18n` object contains locale-dependent properties, some of which can affect the component's behavior, such as <<firstDayOfWeek, firstDayOfWeek>>, <<direction, direction>>, and others.

For instance, let's change the first day of the week and the direction:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/localization-single-component-view.xml[tags=localization-single-component1]

Programmatically you can do the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/LocalizationSingleComponentView.java[tags=localization-single-component2]
----

To change localization globally, add message keys from the FullCalendar add-on to your messages bundle. You can find the complete list of available messages in https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/blob/1e61c4f49db9d31045b421a4d0f33e8137a32542/jmix-translations/content/io/jmix/fullcalendarflowui/messages.properties[jmix/fullcalendarflowui/messages.properties^].

For example, you can translate the default names for months:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component/months=January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December
io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component/monthsShort=Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component/weekdays=Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component/weekdaysShort=Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat
io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component/weekdaysMin=Su, Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa
----

NOTE: Make sure the translated names are in the same order as the original names because the parser expects weekdays from Sunday to Saturday and months from January to December.

[[attributes]]
== Attributes

In Jmix there are many xref:flow-ui:vc/common-attributes.adoc[common attributes] that serve the same purpose for all components.
The following are attributes specific to `calendar`:

[cols="1h,7a,1",grid=rows,frame=none]
|===
|*Name*|*Description*|*Default*

|[[allDayMaintainDurationEnabled]]allDayMaintainDurationEnabled
| Determines how an event’s duration should be mutated when it is dragged from a timed section to an all-day section or vice versa.

- `true` - the duration will remain roughly the same before and after it is dragged to or from an all-day section. "Roughly" because if an event has a duration with hourly precision, it will be rounded down to the nearest whole-day.
- `false` - the event’s duration will be reset to <<defaultAllDayEventDuration, defaultAllDayEventDuration>> if it is being dropped in an all-day section or <<defaultTimedEventDuration, defaultTimedEventDuration>> if it is being dropped in a timed section
| `false`

|[[allDayText]]allDayText
| Sets the all-day text. The text is visible in time-grid display modes.
|-

|[[closeHint]]closeHint
|Sets the hint for the close button in the popover when you click the "more" link.
|-

|[[dateAlignment]]dateAlignment
|Sets the first visible date of <<custom-calendar-display-mode, CustomCalendarDisplayMode>>.

When a custom calendar display mode is being used, and you’d like to guarantee that the calendar begins at a certain interval, like the start-of-week or start-of-month, specify a value like `week` or `month`. If the property is not specified, a reasonable default will be generated based on the display mode’s duration.

If a display mode’s range is explicitly defined by visible date range, this property will be ignored.
|-

|[[dayHeadersVisible]]dayHeadersVisible
|Sets whether the day headers should appear. It works for day-grid, time-grid and month display modes.
|`true`

|[[dayMaxEventRows]]dayMaxEventRows
|Sets rows count of events in day-grid display modes and in "all-day" section in time-grid display modes.

Note that "more" row is included to count. For instance, if the value is `1`, only the "more" row will be shown. Takes precedence over the <<defaultDayMaxEventRowsEnabled, defaultDayMaxEventRowsEnabled>>.
|-

|[[dayMaxEvents]]dayMaxEvents
|Sets rows count of events in day-grid display modes and in "all-day" section in time-grid display modes.

Note that "+ more" row is not included to count. For instance, if the value is  `1`, one event and the "more" row will be shown. Takes precedence over the <<defaultDayMaxEventsEnabled, defaultDayMaxEventsEnabled>>.
|-

|[[dayOfYear]]dayOfYear
|The rule how to define the first week of the year. For instance, if the first day of the week is `1` and the day of year equals to `4`, it means that the week that contains `Jan 4th` is the first week of the year.
|-

|[[defaultAllDay]]defaultAllDay
|Sets the default value for each calendar event's <<allDay, allDay>> property when it is unspecified.

If the property is set to `true`, all events without <<allDay, allDay>> property (e.g. is not specified mapping in a data provider or calendar event returns `null` for this property) will be considered as all-day events.

Note, in this case, events without <<allDay, allDay>> property will be shown as all-day events. If such event will be changed by dragging or resizing, and you have listeners for these events, the component will apply changes to a calendar event, which can lead to modifying entity/ DTO instance.
|`false`

|[[defaultAllDayEventDuration]]defaultAllDayEventDuration
|Sets the default duration of all-day events if they don't specify <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property.

For instance, the property is set to 2 days. The event that has <<allDay, allDay>> property equals to `true` and do not have <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property, will be shown in all-day section and will occupy two days.

Note, calendar event's <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property will remain unset, unless <<forceEventDuration, forceEventDuration>> has been set to `true`. In this case, the calendar will explicitly assign end date-time to an event. If such event will be changed by dragging or resizing, and you have listeners for these events, the component will set to calendar event end date-time value, which can lead to modifying entity/ DTO instance.

This property only affects events with <<allDay, allDay>> property equals to `true`.
|`P1d`

|[[defaultBusinessHoursEnabled]]defaultBusinessHoursEnabled
|Enables default business hours. The default business hour is: `monday - friday` from `9 AM` to `5 PM`.

By default, component sets localized format from `messages` when is created.
This property act as default format for all display modes and for <<custom-calendar-display-mode, CustomCalendarDisplayMode>> until specific property won't be set for these display modes. However, all display-mode properties objects by default explicitly specify the format, thus they override this property.

As component uses https://fullcalendar.io/docs/moment-plugin[moment plugin^] for `FullCalendar`, you should follow the `moment.js` formatting rules: https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/[Moment.js Documentation^]. For instance, the `dd` produces the `Mo` value.

The property change is not applied after component attached to the UI.
|-

|[[defaultTimedEventDuration]]defaultTimedEventDuration
|Sets the default duration for timed events if they don't specify <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property.

For instance, the property is set to 2 hours. The event that has <<allDay, allDay>>`  property equals to  `false` and do not have <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property, will occupy two hours in time slots.

Note, calendar event's <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property will remain unset, unless <<forceEventDuration, forceEventDuration>> has been set to `true`. In this case, the calendar will explicitly assign end date to an event. If such event will be changed by dragging or resizing, and you have listeners for these events, the component will set new value to calendar event's <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property, which can lead to modifying entity/ DTO instance.

This property only affects events with `allDay` property equals to `false`.
|`PT1h`

|[[defaultWeekNumberFormat]]defaultWeekNumberFormat

|-

|[[displayEventTime]]displayEventTime
|Determines visibility of time text of each event.

The property applies to timed-events (not all-day). If set to `true`, time text will always be displayed on the event. If set to `false`, time text will never be displayed on the event. Events that are all-day will never display time text anyhow.
|`true`

|-

|[[eventOrder]]eventOrder
|Sets the list of calendar event properties that should participate in sorting. It is also available to specify properties from event's <<additionalProperties, additionalProperties>> property.

For most calendar display modes, this property determines the vertical ordering of events within the same day. For time-grid display modes however, it determines the horizontal ordering of events within the same time slot.

The default value puts earlier events first. If tied, it puts longer events first. If still tied, it puts all-day events first. If still tied, orders events by title, alphabetically.

If putting a lower-precedent event before a higher-precedent improves compactness, the algorithm will do so. To disable this behavior, set <<eventOrderStrict, eventOrderStrict>> to `true`.

The provided properties are sorted in ascending order. If a property is prefixed with a minus sign like `-title`, sorting will be in descending order.
|`start,-duration,allDay,title`

|[[eventOrderStrict]]eventOrderStrict

|Sets the day that each week begins. The default value is taken from locale.
|-

|[[forceEventDuration]]forceEventDuration
|Makes the component to assign <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property value to events if they do not have it.

Note, if event does not specify <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property, the component will set it explicitly. If such event will be changed by dragging or resizing, and you have listeners for these events, the component will set new value to calendar event <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property, which can lead to modifying entity/ DTO instance.
|`false`

|[[initialDate]]initialDate

[source,java]
----
setMoreLinkHint("Show ${count} more event${count === 1 ? '' : 's'}");
----

It also takes a string definition of JavaScript function that takes count as a parameter. For instance:

- start - `2024-09-01T20:00:00`;
- end - `2024-09-02T02:00:00`;

So, the event spans to another day, but it will be rendered as a one-day event, because the `nextDayThreshold` property is specified. However, If the event has end date - `2024-09-02T10:00:00`, it will be rendered as two-day event.

Only affects timed events that appear on whole-days cells. Whole-day cells occur in day-grid display modes and the all-day slots in the time-grid display modes.

Note that this property is ignored when event's <<allDay, allDay>> property is set to `true`.

- `false` - waits until all data providers have received their data and then renders everything at once, resulting in fewer renders.
|`false`

|[[scrollTime]]scrollTime
|Sets the initial scroll position to a specific time. Users will be able to scroll back to see events before this time. If you want to prevent users from doing this, use the <<slotMinTime, slotMinTime>> instead.

By default, the scroll time is reapplied to the calendar whenever the date range changes. To disable this, set <<scrollTimeReset, scrollTimeReset>> to `false`.

The property change is not applied after component attached to the UI.
|`PT6h`

|[[scrollTimeReset]]scrollTimeReset
|Sets whether the calendar should scroll to <<scrollTime, scrollTime>> every time the date range changes.

|`true`

|[[selectConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled]]selectConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled
|Sets whether the selection must be fully contained within the week’s business hours.
It also respects custom business hours.

This property will be applied if <<selectionEnabled, selectionEnabled>> is enabled.
|`false`

|[[selectConstraintGroupId]]selectConstraintGroupId
|Sets a group ID to limit selection. If group ID is set, only cells with events that contain the same group ID can be selected.
Takes precedence over the <<selectConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled, selectConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled>>.

[[handlers]]
== Handlers

In Jmix there are many xref:flow-ui:vc/common-handlers.adoc[common handlers] that are configured in the same way for all components.
The following are handlers specific to `calendar`:

include::flow-ui:vc/handler-generation-tip.adoc[]

[cols="1h,6a",grid=rows,frame=none]
|===
|*Name*|*Description*

|[[DateClickEvent]]DateClickEvent
|`io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.DateClickEvent` fired when a day cell or time cell is clicked.

|[[DatesSetEvent]]DatesSetEvent
|`io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.DatesSetEvent` fired after the calendar’s date range has been initially set or changed in some way and the DOM of component has been updated.

The calendar’s dates can change any time the user does the following:

- navigates to next and previous;
- switches the display mode;
- clicks a navigation link (e.g.week or day if <<navigationLinksEnabled, navigationLinksEnabled>> is `true`.

The dates can also change when the current-date is manipulated via the API.

|[[DayNavigationLinkClickEvent]]DayNavigationLinkClickEvent
|Fired when the user clicks on day heading navigation link. The navigation link can be activated by the <<navigationLinksEnabled, navigationLinksEnabled>> property.

|[[EventClickEvent]]EventClickEvent
|`io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.EventClickEvent` fired when the calendar event is clicked.

|[[EventDropEvent]]EventDropEvent
|`io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.EventDropEvent` fired when the dragging stops and the event has been moved to a different day or time slot.

|[[EventMouseEnterEvent]]EventMouseEnterEvent
|`io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.EventMouseEnterEvent` fired when the user mouses over a calendar event.

|[[EventMouseLeaveEvent]]EventMouseLeaveEvent
|`io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.EventMouseLeaveEvent` fired when the user mouses out of a calendar event.

|[[EventResizeEvent]]EventResizeEvent
|`io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.EventResizeEvent` fired when the resizing stops and the calendar event's duration has changed.

|[[MoreLinkClickEvent]]MoreLinkClickEvent
|`io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.MoreLinkClickEvent` fired when the user clicks on "more" link. The "more" link can be activated by the following properties:

- <<defaultDayMaxEventRowsEnabled, defaultDayMaxEventRowsEnabled>>
- <<dayMaxEventRows, dayMaxEventRows>>
- <<defaultDayMaxEventsEnabled, defaultDayMaxEventsEnabled>>
- <<dayMaxEvents, dayMaxEvents>>

|[[SelectEvent]]SelectEvent
|`io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.SelectEvent` fired when a date/time selection is made.

Selection mode can be enabled by <<selectionEnabled, selectionEnabled>> property.

|[[UnselectEvent]]UnselectEvent
|`io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.UnselectEvent` fired when the current selection is cleared. A selection might be cleared for a number of reasons:

- The user clicks away from the current selection (doesn’t happen when <<unselectAuto, unselectAuto>> is disabled).
- The user makes a new selection. The unselect event will be fired before the new selection occurs.
- The user moves forward or backward in the current calendar's display mode, or switches to another mode.
- The `unselect()` method is called.

|[[WeekNavigationLinkClickEvent]]WeekNavigationLinkClickEvent
|Fired when the user clicks on the week number navigation link.

The navigation link can be activated by the <<navigationLinksEnabled, navigationLinksEnabled>> property.

|[[dayCellBottomTextClassNamesGenerator]]dayCellBottomText-
ClassNamesGenerator
|Generates CSS class names for day cell's bottom text.

Note, the generator will be invoked only if cell's bottom text is not null.

|[[dayCellBottomTextGenerator]]dayCellBottomTextGenerator
|Generates the bottom text for day cells. It applies only for day-grid month and year and display modes.

Note that in some cases, events in a cell can overlap the text at the bottom. To avoid this, it is recommended to limit the visible number of events. For instance, you can use the <<dayMaxEvents, dayMaxEvents>> property.

|[[dayCellClassNamesGenerator]]dayCellClassNamesGenerator
|Generates CSS class names for day cells. The day cell appears in day-grid and time-grid display modes as an all-day cell.

|[[dayHeaderClassNamesGenerator]]dayHeaderClassNamesGenerator
|Generates CSS class names for day headers. The day header is a cell that shows day of week and date in some display modes.

|[[moreLinkClassNamesGenerator]]moreLinkClassNamesGenerator
|Generates CSS class names for "more" link.

The generator takes precedence over other methods that set CSS class names.

|[[nowIndicatorClassNamesGenerator]]nowIndicatorClassNamesGenerator
|Generates CSS class names for a now-indicator. The now-indicator consists of two parts: the line and the axis.

The now-indicator can be enabled by <<nowIndicatorVisible, nowIndicatorVisible>> property.

|[[slotLabelClassNamesGenerator]]slotLabelClassNamesGenerator
|Generates CSS class names for the slot label, which appears as a cell with a time label in time-grid display modes.

== Elements

Elements of the `calendar` provide a wide range of options to control the appearance, behavior, formatting, data binding and other functionalities.

[TIP]
====
To add an element to a selected component click the xref:studio:screen-designer.adoc#component-inspector[Add] button in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel.
====

[[business-hours-element]]
