= 1. Calendar Data Binding

In this section, you will create:

* The `Meeting` JPA entity.
* The `FullCalendar` component with a data provider.

[[meeting-event]]
== Meeting Event

The `Meeting` will represent an event within the `FullCalendar` component. It requires specific properties for correct display:

* `name` - represents the event title.
* `startDate` - represents the event's start date and time. The component will not display events without a `startDate`.
* `endDate` - represents the event's end date. If `endDate` is not specified, the component will apply a default duration based on the `allDay` property. This tutorial omits the `allDay` property; therefore, events are treated as non-all-day events.

[[create-meeting-entity]]
=== Creating Meeting Entity

Refer to the xref:tutorial:simple-crud.adoc[Simple CRUD] section of the Tutorial for detailed instructions on creating JPA entities.

The `Meeting` entity has the following attributes:

* `name` with `String` type. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `startDate` with `LocalDateTime`. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `endDate` with `LocalDateTime`.
* `user` - has the `Association` attribute type, `User` entity as a Java type and the many-to-one cardinality. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.

The `Meeting` entity does not require standard list and detail views as it will be programmatically generated and displayed within the `FullCalendar` component.

[[generate-meeting]]
=== Generating Meeting

After a user completes all onboarding steps, the application generates a meeting event to review the completed tasks. This event will be displayed in the user's *MyCalendar* view.

The best moment to check whether the user has finished all steps is during the xref:flow-ui:data/data-context.adoc#pre-save-event[PreSaveEvent] of xref:flow-ui:data/data-context.adoc[DataContext]. This event listener checks for incomplete onboarding steps. If no incomplete steps remain, a new meeting event is created.

Next, we implement the `generateOnboardingResultsMeeting()` method. This method creates a `Meeting` event instance scheduled for the next business day.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$/fullcalendar-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/myonboarding/MyOnboardingView.java[tags=onboarding-generate-meeting]
----
<1> Creates and merges a new `Meeting` instance into the `DataContext`, automatically persisting the entity.
<2> Calculates the next business day; if today is Friday, the meeting is scheduled for Monday.
<3> Sets the meeting's start date and time to 9:30 AM on the calculated next business day.

[[add-components]]
== Adding Components to MyCalendar

First, create a new, empty view named *MyCalendar*.

image::creating-my-calendar-view.png[align="center",width="776"]

Studio will generate and display the empty view in the designer.

[[load-data]]
=== Loading Data

Before adding the `FullCalendar` component, create a xref:flow-ui:data/collection-container.adoc[collection container] for the `Meeting` entity.

In the actions panel, click *Add Component*, navigate to the *Data components* section, and double-click *Collection container*. In the dialog that appears, select `Meeting` in the *Entity* field and click *OK*.

----

The current data loader configuration retrieves all events from all users. However, users should only view their own events. To implement this filtering, modify the JPQL query - either using the editor or manually - to include a condition that restricts results to the currently logged-in user:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/mycalendar/my-calendar.xml[tags=onboarding-add-fullcalendar3]
----

We obtain the currently logged-in user from the `CurrentAuthentication` bean and pass this information to the data loader within the xref:flow-ui:views/view-events.adoc#before-show-event[BeforeShowEvent]:

* Subscribe o the `BeforeShowEvent`.
* Inject the `meetingsDl` loader.
* Inject the `CurrentAuthentication` bean.

Now we can set a parameter for the loader to fetch events for the current user:

----

[[add-fullcalendar]]
=== Adding FullCalendar Component

In the actions panel, click *Add Component*,  locate the `FullCalendar` item, and double-click it.

Then new `calendar` element will be generated. Configure the `id`, `height` and `width` attributes as shown below.

include::example$fullcalendar-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/sampleone/sample-one.xml[tags=onboarding-add-fullcalendar1]
----

[[add-data-provider]]
=== Adding Data Provider

The data provider is a source of events displayed in the `FullCalendar`. There are different types of data providers, but we will use the data provider based on a xref:flow-ui:data/data-containers.adoc[data container].

To add the *ContainerDataProvider* to the `FullCalendar` component:

. Select the `calendar` component in the *Jmix UI* structure panel or the view's XML descriptor.
. Click the *Add* button in the inspector panel.
. From the dropdown menu, select *Data Providers* → *ContainerDataProvider*.

image::add-container-data-provider.png[align="center",width="416"]

In the dialog that appears, select `meetingsDc`.

The `containerDataProvider` element allows configuration of entity property mappings. The `Meeting` entity includes the following properties:

* `name`
* `startDate`
* `endDate`

Therefore, the following attributes should be specified:

Let’s take a look: the complete description of our calendar is as follows:

include::example$fullcalendar-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/samplethree/sample-three.xml[tags=onboarding-add-fullcalendar4]
----

Launch the application and log in as the `admin` user. The `admin` user does not have onboarding steps, so we need to generate them:

* Access the `User.list` view by selecting *Users* from the application menu.
* Select the `admin` user in the *DataGrid* and click the *Edit* button. Then, fill *Joining Date* field, generate onboarding steps and save the changes.
* Access the `MyCalendar` view by selecting *My Calendar* from the application menu.
