= 1. FullCalendar data binding

In this section, you will create:

* `Meeting` JPA entity.
* `FullCalendar` component with event provider.

[[meeting-event]]
== Meeting event

`Meeting` entity will be an event in the `FullCalendar` component. It should have corresponding properties to be correctly displayed in the component:

- `name` - is the event title.
- `startDate` - the start date in the component. The component does not display events without a start date.
- `endDate` - the end date in the component. If the end date is not specified, the component will add a default time duration for the event depending on the allDay property. In this tutorial, the `allDay` property is not used, so the component considers the events as non-all-day events.

[[create-meeting-entity]]
=== Create Meeting Entity

You can find detailed instructions for creating entities in the xref:tutorial:simple-crud.adoc[Simple CRUD] section of the Tutorial.

The `Meeting` entity has the following attributes:

* `name` with `String` type. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `startDate` with `LocalDateTime`. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.
* `endDate` with `LocalDateTime`.
* `user` - has the `Association` attribute type, `User` entity as a Java type and the many-to-one cardinality. Select the *Mandatory* checkbox.

The `Meeting` entity does not have standard views: list and details, because it will be generated programmatically and displayed in the `FullCalendar` component.

[[generate-meeting]]
=== Generate Meeting in My Onboarding view

When the employee completes all steps then the application should generate a meeting event to discuss completed tasks. And we'll display this event in *MyCalendar* view.

The best moment to check whether the employee has finished all steps is during the xref:flow-ui:data/data-context.adoc#pre-save-event[PreSaveEvent] of xref:flow-ui:data/data-context.adoc[DataContext]. In the event listener, we should filter out all uncompleted steps. If the list is empty, we should generate an event.

----

Next, we will implement the `generateOnboardingResultsMeeting()` method. This method should create an instance of the `Meeting` event that starts on the next working day.

include::example$/fullcalendar-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/myonboarding/MyOnboardingView.java[tags=onboarding-generate-meeting]
----
<1> Creates and merges a new `Meeting` instance into the `DataContext`. Thus, the meeting entity will be saved as well.
<2> Calculates the next working day. If today is Friday, then meeting should start on Monday.
<3> Creates the start date of meeting event. The meeting will start on the next working day at 9:30 AM.

[[add-components]]
== Add components on MyCalendar

Firstly, create a blank view and call it *MyCalendar*.

Studio will generate an empty view and display it in the designer.

[[load-data]]
=== Load Data

Before adding the `FullCalendar` component, let's create a xref:flow-ui:data/collection-container.adoc[collection container] for the `Meeting` entity.

Click *Add Component* in the actions panel, then navigate to the *Data components* section double-click on *Collection container*. In the dialog that appears, select `Meeting` in the *Entity* field and click *OK*.

----

The current configuration of loader fetches all events from all users. However, users should only see their own events. We will add a condition to filter events by the current user. Modify the JPQL query using the editor or manually:

include::example$fullcalendar-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/mycalendar/my-calendar.xml[tags=onboarding-add-fullcalendar3]
----

We will get the current user from `CurrentAuthentication` bean and pass it to the loader on the xref:flow-ui:views/view-events.adoc#before-show-event[BeforeShowEvent]:

* Subscribe on `BeforeShowEvent`.
* Inject `meetingsDl` loader.
* Inject `CurrentAuthentication` bean.

"Now we can set a parameter for the loader to fetch events for the current user:

----

[[add-fullcalendar]]
=== Add FullCalendar

Click *Add Component* in the actions panel, find the `FullCalendar` item, and then double-click it.

Then new `calendar` element will be generated. Configure the `id`, `height` and `width` attributes as shown below.

include::example$fullcalendar-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/sampleone/sample-one.xml[tags=onboarding-add-fullcalendar1]
----

[[add-event-provider]]
=== Add Event Provider

The event provider is a source of events displayed in the `FullCalendar`. There are different types of event providers, but we will use the event provider based on a xref:flow-ui:data/data-containers.adoc[data container].

To add the *ContainerEventProvider* to the `FullCalendar` component, follow these instructions:

* Choose the calendar in the Jmix UI structure panel or in the view XML descriptor.
* Click the *Add* button in the inspector panel.
* From the drop-down list, select *Event providers* → *ContainerEventProvider*.

image::add-container-event-provider.png[align="center"]

In the dialog that appears, select `meetingsDc`.

The `containerEventProvider` element contains a set of properties that the user can specify to configure the mapping of entity's properties. The `Meeting` entity has the following properties:

* `name`
* `startDate`
* `endDate`

So we should specify the following attributes:

[source, xml, indent=0]

include::example$fullcalendar-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/sampletwo/sample-two.xml[tags=onboarding-add-fullcalendar3]
----

Let’s take a look: the complete description of our calendar is as follows:

[source, xml, indent=0]

include::example$fullcalendar-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/samplethree/sample-three.xml[tags=onboarding-add-fullcalendar4]
----

Launch the application and log in as the `admin` user. The `admin` user does not have onboarding steps, so we need to generate them:

* Select the *Users* item in the application menu to access `User.list` view.
* Select the `admin` user in the *DataGrid* and click the *Edit* button. Then, generate the onboarding steps and save the changes.
* Select the *My Calendar* item in the application menu to access `MyCalendar` view.
