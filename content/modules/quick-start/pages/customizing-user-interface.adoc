== Customizing the user interface

Let’s add a calendar view to browse talks in addition to the grid view. For the browser screen, we’ll add tab control, put a calendar on it and provide a functionality to edit and reschedule talks using this calendar like in the picture below:

Open talk-browse.xml file in designer and wrap the sessions table into tab sheet by right-click on the `talksTable` component in the Component Hierarchy window.

Add one more tab page under the TabSheet by dragging-and-drop *Tab* component from the *Component Palette*.

Put a calendar control on it.

Select the TabSheet element in the Component Hierarchy window and select expanded in the Component Inspector. Studio asks for an ID. In Jmix, we need IDs to reference a screen element in the code. Set `talksTabSheet` id for the component.

Assign ids `calendarTab` and `tableTab` for the tabs. Then set captions *Talks calendar* and *Talks table* for these tabs accordingly. You can create internationalized messages by clicking on 🌐 icon near the *caption* property.

Update the calendar - assign the `talksDc` data container.

Then assign id `talksCalendar` to the calendar component and set this id as the *expand* property value for the `calendarTab` component. After this the calendar should be expanded to all free space on its tab.

In Jmix generic UI, components can be bound to entities and their properties.

Let’s bind the calendar to the data collection fetched in the screen to the `talksDc` container. Use the search field to find properties and bind:

* *startDateProperty* to a talk’s start Date
* *endDateProperty* to a talk’s end Date
* *captionProperty* to a talk’s topic
* And *descriptionProperty* to a talk’s description

Let’s make the calendar to show only working hours.

In addition to the visual designer, you can use the XML markup editor. Let’s add navigation buttons.

Restart the application and reopen *Talk browser* screen in the application. Now you can see talks are displayed on the calendar.
