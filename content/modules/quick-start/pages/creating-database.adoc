== Database creation
For this example, we will use in-memory database - HSQLDB, so the database itself will be created automatically. If you want to use a different RDBMS like MySQL or PostgreSQL, please create an empty database according to your RDBMS documentation.

You can find database settings in the Jmix project window located in the bottom left corner of the Jmix Studio window.

You can double-click on the *Main Data Store* node to see database settings.

If you would prefer using a different RDBMS for this quick start, make sure that URL, username and password match the connection parameters for the database that you had created manually.

Jmix uses Liquibase for database creation and updates, so we need to generate Liquibase scrips to create the database for the conference planner. Jmix Studio analyzes the existing database schema and generates scripts to synchronize the existing JPA data model and database tables.

To start liquibase scripts generation, right-click on the *Main Data Store* node in Jmix project window and select *Generate Diff Changelog*.

You can review the generated scripts in the project sources in `src/main/resources/<project package>/liquibase` folder.

You can add custom scripts if you want to add some specific things like additional indexes or insert statements for the initial data. Please refer to the link:https://docs.liquibase.com/home.html[Liquibase documentation^] for more information.

After scripts are created, you can apply them to the database. Right-click on the *Main Data Store* node in the Jmix project window and select *Update*

The database has been created.
