== Adding Business Logic

Now we will use Jmix Studio to create a service that implements business logic and use this service in a screen. It will be a Spring bean for the talks rescheduling that will ensure that one speaker doesn’t have more than two talks in one day.

Use a toolbar in the xref:studio:tool-window.adoc[Jmix tool window] to open commonly used actions. Select *Spring Bean*.

Enter the package name - `service` and the class name - `TalksScheduleService`.

Studio will generate an empty class.

Let's create the `rescheduleTalk` method. You can see its implementation below:  

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$sample-planner/src/main/java/com/company/planner/service/TalksScheduleService.java[tags=task-schedule-service]
----

<1> The `rescheduleTalk` method accepts a talk that should be rescheduled and new talk start time. 
<2> Calculates new start time of the day when the session is planned.
<3> Calculates new end time of the day when the session is planned.
<4> We use Jmix API for data access - xref:data-access:data-manager.adoc[DataManager] class. With this class, we create a JPQL query to check if there are any talks scheduled for the speaker in a defined time span and add parameter values to it. To inject `DataManager` into the service, use the *Inject* button on the top of the code editor, and then select `DataManager` in the pop-up screen.
<5> Checks the query result.
<6> Returns the original talk instance if a speaker has two or more talks for the day.
<7> Updates the talk with a new start date if a speaker has less than two talks for the day.
<8> Returns the updated talk.

The service is ready, let’s add it to the talks browser screen. It will be invoked for the drag-and-drop event in the calendar.

In the `talk-browse.xml` select `talksCalendar` and go to the *Handlers* tab in the *Component Inspector* window. Select *CalendarEventMoveEvent* and click the ▶ icon to generate the method stub and move to the controller.

You need to inject `TalksScheduleService` to the screen before implementing the event handler. Here is the implementation of the method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$sample-planner/src/main/java/com/company/planner/screen/talk/TalkBrowse.java[tags=calendar-event-move]
----

<1> We extract the talk entity from the calendar event and pass it to the service to reschedule this talk. 
<2> After that, we just refresh the screen data programmatically.

To have the service redeployed, we need to restart the application. After restarting, we can open the calendar. We have drag-and-drop rescheduling functionality for the calendar. You can test it by adding an extra talk and trying to reschedule it.
