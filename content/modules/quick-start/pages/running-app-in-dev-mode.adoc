== Running the application in development mode

To run the application, you can use *Run Configuration* tool on the top of the IDE window.

After some time you can access the application using the browser. By default, the URL will be link:http://localhost:8080/[http://localhost:8080/^] .

You can see the application log file in the bottom of the IDE in the *Run* window.

Open the URL in your web browser and log into the application using “admin” as a username. The password is “admin” by default. You can find screens for entities manipulation under *Application* menu.

Then let’s add some data to the database: a couple of speakers and two talks scheduled for the rest of the week. You can try to enter invalid email for a speaker and see that email validator works as expected.

Generated screens are good for basic operations, but in the real world, UI is usually more complex.
