== Creating application's data model

The first task is creating entities. The business domain model has only two classes: Speaker and Talk. The relation is one-to-many. One speaker can conduct many talks.

For a starter, let’s create the `Speaker` entity. To do this, you just need to expand `src/main/java` folder, right-click on any package in your source code and select `New -> JPA Entity...`:

Enter entity’s class - "Speaker". For this sample application, we do not need to change other entity parameters.

In the entity designer, create attributes according to the specification:

[cols="3, 2, 2, 5" options="header"]
|===
|Name |Type |Mandatory |Other constraints
|firstName|String (255)|Yes|
|lastName|String (255)||
|email|String (1024)|Yes|“Email” validator
|===

In Jmix we use standard JPA entities, so you can create them using either code editor or visual designer:

In the visual designer, just click on "+" icon to add attributes to the entity, Jmix Studio will generate class members for you.

To add validation to the *email* attribute, create this attribute and then select *Email* validator in the *Validation* section in right part of the entity designer.

Click on the `not set` label to invoke the validator editor and enable the validator. You can specify a custom error message or a regexp for validation if needed.

To display an entity in a readable format, you can select one of the fields or use a method annotated with `@InstanceName`. For now, we will use `lastName` field for this. We can choose the field in the entity designer.

If we open the *Text* tab on the bottom of the entity designer, we can see just a JPA-annotated java class. The generated code can be updated if needed, designer will be updated accordingly when you switch to the *Designer* tab.

Let’s move further and create the `Talk` entity and link it to the `Speaker` class. Fields specification table follows. The talk end time will be a calculated value, being the start date and time plus duration. Talk's `End time` field will be a calculated field, we will create it later.

[cols="1, 4, 1" options="header"]
|===
|Name |Type |Mandatory
|topic|String (255)|Yes
|startDate|LocalDateTime|Yes
//|endDate|LocalDateTime|
|speaker|Association to the `Speaker` entity, many-to-one cardinality|Yes
|duration|Integer|Yes
|description|String (Unlimited)|
|===

Look at the mandatory reference to the speaker attribute. The relation is many-to-one, so, we’ll define an association field called "speaker" that references the `Speaker` class. In the end, the field definition should look like this:

For the `Talk` entity let's choose the `topic` attribute as the instance name

We have almost created the entity model for our application.
