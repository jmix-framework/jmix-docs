= Getting Started with Search

This guide provides instructions on initiating Search functionality within your application.

Suppose you wish to introduce a few entities to your application and enable searching across their attributes.

To begin, follow these steps:

. Include Search in your project following the guidelines in the xref:search:index.adoc#installation[installation] section.
. xref:search:index.adoc#connecting-to-search-engine-service[Configure] connection based on the service's location.

[[data-model-views-creation]]
== Create Data Model and Views

Let's create the classes listed below:

. The `Status` enumeration with the `SILVER` and `GOLD` values.
. The `Customer` entity with the fields:

* `firstName` with `String` type
* `lastName` with `String` type
* `status` with `Status` type
* `card` with `FileRef` type

. The `Order` entity with the fields:

* `date` with `Date` type
* `number` with `String` type
* `amount` with `Integer` type
* `product` with `String` type
* `customer` with association to `Customer`, many-to-one cardinality

Set up the xref:data-model:entities.adoc#instance-name[instance name] for the `Order` entity to be displayed as the search result.

Create detail and list views for the `Customer` and `Order` entities.

[[index-definition]]
== Create Index Definition Interface

Next, it is necessary to establish an Index Definition - an interface outlining which entities and attributes are to be indexed. Suppose we intend to search orders based on their number, product name, customer status, or customer last name. Within the Index Definition, we will define a method to specify the required attributes.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/service/OrderIndexDefinition.java[tags=index-definition;order-mapping]
----
. The interface should be annotated with `@JmixEntitySearchIndex` with the required parameter `entity`.
. The interface can be named arbitrarily.
. The `@AutoMappedField` annotation automatically maps requested properties. Here, we will utilize the `includeProperties` parameter to indicate the attributes to be indexed.
. The method can be named at your discretion.

[[configure-index-naming]]
== Configure Index Naming
By default, index name is formed as `<prefix><entity_name>`. Default prefix is `search_index_`.

As you may utilize the same Elasticsearch/OpenSearch service across multiple projects, it is advisable to customize the default prefix for unique index names. To implement this change, add the following property to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=prefix]
----

As alternative way you can specify full index name in `indexName` attribute of `@JmixEntitySearchIndex`.

[[configure-indexing-queue]]
== Configure Indexing Queue Processing

The Jmix application monitors data modifications but does not automatically synchronize them with search engine service. To ensure regular updates of indexes, simply add the xref:quartz:index.adoc[] add-on to the project. The Search add-on will leverage Quartz for scheduled processing of the indexing queue using default configurations.

[[create-search-view]]
== Create Search View

. Create an empty view named *Search* by utilizing the `Blank view` Studio template.
. Click *Add Component* in the actions panel, find the `SearchField` item, and then double-click it.
. The newly added `searchField` element will appear in both the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel and in the XML. You can configure attributes like `id`, `height`, `width`, etc., in the same way as it is done for other xref:flow-ui:vc/components.adoc[UI components].
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/search/search-view.xml[tags=search-field]
----

Now, the view includes a text field for inputting the search term and a button to execute the search.

[[test-searching]]
== Test Searching in Application

Now, we are ready to launch and test the application.

Initially, add some instances of the `Customer` and `Order` entities.

Navigate to the *Search* view to locate customers with the `Silver` status.

The search outcomes will appear in the *Search results* view.

Clicking on a result will redirect you to the entity detail view.
