= Using Search in UI

[[visual-components]]
== Visual Components

The Search add-on provides two UI components: `SearchField` and `FullTextFilter`.

These components are available in the *Add Component* palette of the Studio xref:studio:view-designer.adoc[View Designer] as soon as you install the add-on in your project.

If you don’t use the view designer, declare the `search` namespace in your view’s XML descriptor manually:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/search/search-view.xml[tags=xmlns]
----

[[search-field]]
=== SearchField

The `SearchField` component presents a text input field along with a button for executing searches.

Here's a usage example of the `SearchField` component within a view:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/search/search-view.xml[tags=xmlns;view;search-field]
----

Attributes of the `SearchField` component:

* `searchStrategy` - determines the search strategy applied. If no strategy is specified, the default one is used.
* `entities` - specifies the entities for searching. Multiple entities can be listed as a comma-separated sequence:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/search/my-search-view.xml[tags=search-field]
----

By default, `searchField` opens the built-in `SearchResultsView`. This view handles the search engine querying process and presents a result list within the navigation view or in a new dialog, based on the `openMode` attribute of `searchField`.

If you wish to modify this functionality, you can configure the `SearchCompletedHandler` in the following manner:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/search/SearchView.java[tags=SearchCompletedEvent]
----

Alternatively, you can use the `setSearchCompletedHandler()` method of the component.

[[full-text-filter]]
=== FullTextFilter

The `FullTextFilter` component functions similarly to the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/propertyFilter.adoc[] component.

Here's an example of using `fullTextFilter` in the view:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/search/filter-view.xml[tags=data;layout;fullTextFilter;dataGrid]
----

Attributes of the `FullTextFilter` component:

* `dataLoader` specifies the `DataLoader` to be filtered.
* `searchStrategy` determines the search strategy to be employed. If not explicitly defined, a default strategy is utilized.
* `autoApply` - when set to `true`, the `FullTextFilter` component automatically applies itself to the `DataLoader` upon changes to its value.

`FullTextFilter` works as follows: it finds identifiers of entities through a full-text search, and subsequently appends a condition containing these identifiers to the data loader. Consequently, when a `DataGrid` is linked to this data loader, it will display only those records that match the full-text search criteria, combined with other filters, if any.

[[search-strategies]]
=== Search Strategies

A search strategy defines how the search term is processed. Basically it configures search request with some query.

The `SearchField` and `FullTextFilter` components support the following built-in search strategies:

* `anyTermAnyField` - a document matches if it contains at least one of input words in any indexed field.

* `allTermsAnyField` - a document matches if it contains all input words in any field in any order.  This strategy is set by default.

* `allTermsSingleField` - a document matches if it has at least one field that contains all input words in any order.

* `phrase` - a document matches if it has at least one field that contains all input words in the provided order.

You can set the proper strategy by using the `strategy` attribute, for example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/search/filter-view.xml[tags=strategy]
----

To override the default strategy, add the following property to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=default-strategy]
----

[[custom-search-strategies]]
==== Custom Search Strategies
Additionally, you can create a custom search strategy. For that purpose, you need to create a new Spring bean implementing one of the platform-specific interfaces:

* `OpenSearchSearchStrategy` - if you use OpenSearch.
* `ElasticsearchSearchStrategy` - if you use Elasticsearch.

Then you need to implement 2 methods:

* `String getName()` - should return a unique strategy name.

* `void configureRequest(SearchRequest.Builder requestBuilder, SearchContext searchContext)` - configure you search request using provided builder according to your requirements.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/service/CustomOpenSearchSearchStrategy.java[tags=strategy]
----

After that, you can assign your custom strategy to the `SearchField` or `FullTextFilter` component using the strategy name.

[[fts-condition-in-filter-component]]
== Full-text Search Condition in GenericFilter Component

When the Search add-on is added to the project, a new condition appears in the *Add condition* dialog of the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/genericFilter.adoc[GenericFilter] component:

image:search:add_condition.png[align="center",width="1151"]

Within the *Full-text filter condition editor* dialog, you can define a caption for the full-text filter and choose a search strategy. If no search strategy is selected, then the default one is used.

image:search:condition_editor.png[align="center",width="641"]

Subsequently, the records in the list component linked to the filter will undergo filtering based on the outcome of the full-text search.

[[using-search-api-in-views]]
== Using Search API in Views

You can use Search API in view controllers. Let's look at the example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/search-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/search/UsingApiView.java[tags=inject;click-event]
----
<1> API is called from the view when clicking on a button.
<2> Defining the search string is mandatory: here, the query will look through all fields marked for indexing that contain the `"silver"` string.
<3> Adds the conditions for the query: firstly, the max amount of records in the result set. Default value is `10`.
<4> Next, the list of entities to search within. By default, all indexed entities are included.
<5> The `EntitySearcher` service is used to start searching.
<6> `SearchResultProcessor` is used for fetching entities from the search result.
