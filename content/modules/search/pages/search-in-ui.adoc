= Using Search in UI

[[visual-components]]
== Visual Components

The Search add-on provides two UI components: `SearchField` and `FullTextFilter`. To enable using these components in screens, declare the `search` namespace in the root element in the screen XML descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/search/ex1/screen/search/search-screen.xml[tags=namespace]
----

[[search-fields]]
=== SearchField

The `SearchField` component provides an input field with a button that runs searching.

An example of using `SearchField` in a screen:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/search/ex1/screen/search/search-screen.xml[tags=search-field]
----

`SearchField` attributes:

* `searchStrategy` - a search strategy used for searching. If the strategy is not defined, then a default strategy is used.
* `entities` - searching will be performed within the specified entities. Multiple entities can be specified as a comma-separated list:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/search/ex1/screen/search/search-screen-handler2.xml[tags=entities]
----

By default, `searchField` opens the built-in `SearchResultsScreen` that displays a list of results. To change this behavior, you can set `SearchCompletedHandler` as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/search/ex1/screen/search/SearchScreenHandler2.java[tags=my-search-field;screen-builders;handler]
----

Alternatively, you can use the `setSearchCompletedHandler()` method of the component.

[[full-text-filter]]
=== FullTextFilter

The `FullTextFilter` component works like xref:backoffice-ui:vcl/components/property-filter.adoc[PropertyFilter].

An example of using `fullTextFilter` in the screen:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/search/ex1/screen/search/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter1;filter2]
----

`FullTextFilter` attributes:

* `dataLoader` - a `DataLoader` that must be filtered.
* `searchStrategy` - a search strategy used for searching. If the strategy is not defined, then a default strategy is used.
* `autoApply` - set to `true` if the `filter` component should be automatically applied to the `DataLoader` when the component value is changed.

`FullTextFilter` works as follows: it finds identifiers of entities by the full-text search, and then adds a condition with these identifiers to the data loader. As a result, `Table` or `DataGrid` connected to the same data loader will show only records that match the full-text search criteria, combined with other filters, if any.

[[search-strategies]]
=== Search Strategies

A search strategy defines how the search term is handled.

The `SearchField` and `FullTextFilter` components support the following search strategies:

* `anyTermAnyField` - a document matches if it contains at least one of input words in any indexed field.

* `allTermsAnyField` - a document matches if it contains all input words in any field in any order.  This strategy is set by default.

* `allTermsSingleField` - a document matches if it has at least one field that contains all input words in any order.

* `phrase` - a document matches if it has at least one field that contains all input words in the provided order.

You can set the proper strategy by using the `strategy` attribute, for example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/search/ex1/screen/search/search-screen-handler1.xml[tags=strategy]
----

To override the default strategy, add the following property to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=default-strategy]
----

Also, you can create your own search strategy. For that purpose, you need to create a new bean extending `io.jmix.search.searching.SearchStrategy` class and implementing two methods:

* `String getName()` - should return a unique strategy name.

* `void configureRequest(SearchRequest searchRequest, SearchContext searchContext)` - should configure the incoming `SearchRequest` as needed.

After that, you can set your strategy to the `SearchField` or `FullTextFilter` component by the strategy name.

[[fts-condition-in-filter-component]]
== Full-text Search Condition in Filter Component

When the Search add-on is added to the project, a new condition appears in the *Add condition* window of the `Filter` component:

image:search:add_condition.png[Add Condition to Filter, align="center"]

In the *Full-text filter condition editor* window you can specify a caption for the full-text filter and select a search strategy. If no search strategy is selected, then the default one is used.

image:search:condition_editor.png[Condition Editor, align="center"]

Records in the list component associated with the filter will be filtered based on the full-text search result.

[[using-search-api-in-screens]]
== Using Search API in Screens

You can use Search API in screen controllers. Let's look at the example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/search/ex1/screen/search/UsingApiScreen.java[tags=entity-searcher;search-result-processor;click-event]
----
<1> API is called from the screen when clicking on a button.
<2> Sets conditions for the query: an entity, a string and amount of records in the result.
//The query will look for an entity of an Order type through fields marked for indexing that contain an `"apple"` string. 
<3> The `EntitySearcher` service is used to start searching.
<4> `SearchResultProcessor` is used for fetching entities from the search result.
