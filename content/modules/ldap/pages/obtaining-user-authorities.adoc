= Obtaining User Authorities

When roles are synchronized in accordance with LDAP, they are obtained in a few steps:

* **Obtaining roles from groups a user is a member of**
+
The resulting list of authorities consists of group names a user is a member of. By default, the `cn` attribute of the group is used to obtain the authority name. You can change this attribute in the xref:ldap:properties.adoc#jmix.ldap.group-role-attribute[jmix.ldap.group-role-attribute].
+
* **Obtaining roles from user attributes**
+
Optionally user roles can be added based on their own attributes.
+
Register a Spring bean, that implements the `LdapUserAdditionalRoleProvider` interface and implement the `getAdditionalRoles()` method within this bean. For example:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Component("demo_MyLdapUserAdditionalRoleProvider")
public class MyLdapUserAdditionalRoleProvider implements LdapUserAdditionalRoleProvider {

    @Override
    public Set<GrantedAuthority> getAdditionalRoles(DirContextOperations user, String username) {
        return new HashSet<>();
    }
}
----
+
* **Applying default roles**
+
The xref:ldap:properties.adoc#jmix.ldap.default-roles[jmix.ldap.default-roles] property contains a comma-separated list of roles that will be assigned to every user authenticated in LDAP.

The resulting list of authorities is passed through `JmixLdapGrantedAuthoritiesMapper` in order to get the final collection of authorities. This mapper is used to map previously obtained authorities to Jmix `GrantedAuthority`.

For example, consider that the initial list contains a simple authority with the value of `Administrators`. First, the mapper tries to find a resource role with the same role code. If the role hasn't been found, it searches for a row-level role with the same code. If the role isn't found, it won't be added to the final list.

Also, you can implement the `LdapAuthorityToJmixRoleCodesMapper` interface to map LDAP authorities and Jmix role codes. It is available to map several role codes to one LDAP group. Roles can be either resource or low-level.

In the example below, the bean implements mapping the `mathematician` and `scientists` LDAP groups to Jmix role codes:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ldap/ex1/app/CustomAuthorityMapperBean.java[tags=bean]
----
<1> Overrides the method that takes an LDAP authority as input parameter and returns a collection of role codes that matches the given authority.
<2> In case of the `mathematicians` group, an LDAP user obtains the `system-full-access` role.
<3> In case of the `scientists` group, an LDAP user obtains two roles: `scientists-resource-role` and `scientists-row-level-role`.
