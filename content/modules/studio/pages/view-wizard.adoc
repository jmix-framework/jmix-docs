= View Creation Wizard
:page-aliases: screen-wizard.adoc

Studio provides a wizard that helps you to create xref:flow-ui:views/views.adoc[views] from templates. To create a new view, click *New -> View* in the xref:studio:tool-window.adoc[Jmix Tool Window].

The wizard generates basic code for your view, including necessary components and configuration, saving you time and effort. It offers templates for various view types, including:

* Entity-based views: for displaying and editing data related to a specific xref:data-model:entities.adoc[entity].
* DTO-based views: for displaying and editing data from xref:data-model:entities.adoc#dto[DTO].
* Other view types: the wizard can generate blank views not associated with an entity; xref:flow-ui:fragments/fragments.adoc[fragments]; main view with xref:flow-ui:vc/components/horizontalMenu.adoc[top menu]; and more.

== Creating Entity-based Views

If you want to create CRUD views for an entity, you can select the entity in the tree and right-click *New -> View*.

Another way is to click *Views -> Create View* on the xref:studio:entity-designer.adoc#actions-panel[actions panel] of the Entity Designer.

On the *Create Jmix View* page of wizard, choose the appropriate template from the list provided by the Studio.

On the next step, you can modify the automatically generated view properties.

[NOTE]
====
Select the *Use Data Repositories* checkbox in the *Advanced* section, and choose an existing xref:studio:data-repository-wizard.adoc[data repository] from the dropdown. The wizard will generate the load and save delegates that invoke appropriate repository methods.
====

On the *Entity list and detail options* step, you can configure how your views display and interact with data from an entity.

For example, you can set up data grid xref:flow-ui:actions/list-actions.adoc[actions], which will be displayed on the list view. DataGrid configurations like xref:flow-ui:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc#selectionMode[multi-select], column xref:flow-ui:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc#columnReorderingAllowed[reordering], column xref:flow-ui:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc#resizable[resizing] are also enabled.

Click *Next*.

At the *Entity list view fetch plan* and *Entity detail view fetch plan* steps, you can select the amount of data that will be displayed in the views. You can use one of the xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#built-in-fetch-plans[built-in] fetch plans or create your own with the help of xref:studio:fetch-plan-designer.adoc[Fetch Plan Designer] or xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#creating-fetch-plans[programmatically].

Click *Next*.

The final step of the wizard allows you to set titles for the views.

After clicking the *Create* button, the view XML descriptor and view controller will be generated. The xref:localization:message-bundles.adoc[Message Bundle] file will be updated. In case of creating a list view, a new menu item will be added to the main menu.

Use the xref:studio:view-designer.adoc[View designer] to set up your views.

[[creating-dto-based-views]]
== Creating DTO-based Views

The steps in the view creation wizard for DTO are similar to steps described in <<creating-entity-based-views,Creating Entity-based Views>>.

[[creating-blank-view]]
== Creating Blank View

The `Blank View` template provides a starting point for creating a custom view. It provides a basic structure with minimal pre-generated components and logic.

Use this template when you need complete control over every aspect of the view's design and behavior. You'll be responsible for adding all the necessary components, layouts, data binding, and event handling manually.

Use the xref:studio:view-designer.adoc[View designer] to set up your view.

[[creating-blank-fragment]]
== Creating Blank Fragment

The `Blank Fragment` template is designed for creating reusable view xref:flow-ui:fragments/fragments.adoc[fragments] that can be embedded within other views or fragments.

image::blank-fragment-template.png[align="center",width="780"]

After clicking the *Create* button, the fragment's XML and class files are generated.

Use the xref:studio:view-designer.adoc[View designer] to configure the fragment.

[[main-view-top-menu]]
== Creating Main View with Top Menu

By default, Jmix provides the main view with a list menu.

Studio's View Creation Wizard offers a template to create a main view with a top menu.

If you want to use the new view instead of the existing main view, select the *Use as default main view* checkbox on the first step of the wizard.

image::main-view-top-menu-template.png[align="center",width="780"]

Studio will replace the `layout` attribute of the `@Route` annotation in all views and set the new view in the xref:flow-ui:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.main-view-id[jmix.ui.main-view-id] application property.
