= Composite Projects

Studio allows you to develop multiple add-ons and applications as a single IDE project, even if they are located in different source code repositories.

To create a composite project, start the project wizard and select the *Composite Project* template. Studio will create a project with the following structure (provided that the project name is `demo`):

----
root-dir/
    demo-all/
        build.gradle
        settings.gradle
----

After that, you can create or add subprojects using the *New -> Subproject* actions of the Jmix Tool Window. We recommend placing subprojects inside the project root next to the `<project-name>-all` aggregator project.

Studio shows the composite project and all subprojects as top-level nodes in the Jmix Tool Window:

You can edit common properties of all subprojects. Click *Settings->Project Properties* on the toolbar of the Jmix Tool Window. Select *All subprojects* when Studio asks you which project you want to edit:

The common properties include the artifact repository settings and Jmix framework version. So, you can upgrade all subprojects to a newer Jmix version at once.

Studio can generate Liquibase changelogs in add-ons, including when working with them in composite projects.

To generate a changelog, you first need to define a xref:studio:data-stores.adoc[Data Store] in the add-on. It will be displayed in the Jmix tree:

image::studio:add-on-data-store.png[align="center",width="272"]

Its settings will be stored in the `jmix-studio.xml` file instead of the Java configuration.

Now, you can execute the *Generate Liquibase Changelog* action on the Data Store.

In a composite project, you should specify a Data Store for the same add-on again, because the composite project has its own `jmix-studio.xml` file located in the `<project-name>-all` aggregator project. So, data store settings will be stored separately for when you are working on the add-on in a standalone project and in a composite project, but the set of generated changelogs will be the same.
