== Working Behind Proxy

=== Configure IDEA Proxy Settings

. Open *Settings* dialog from the main menu: *File → Settings*.
. Choose *Appearance & Behavior → System Settings → HTTP Proxy* section.
. Set necessary setting values and press *Check connection* to test them.

For more information, go to https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-http-proxy.html[IntelliJ IDEA documentation^].

=== Configure Gradle Proxy Settings

. Find the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file in the user home directory.
. Edit this file and add the required proxy parameters as described in the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:accessing_the_web_via_a_proxy[Gradle documentation^]:
+
[source,properties]
----
systemProp.http.proxyHost=192.168.57.1
systemProp.http.proxyPort=3128
systemProp.http.proxyUser=developer
systemProp.http.proxyPassword=Df887..33
systemProp.http.nonProxyHosts=*.nonproxyrepos.com|localhost
----

=== Configure Git Proxy Settings

If you want to download projects, for example, from GitHub repositories, configure proxy settings for the Git version control tool as well.

Run the command:

[source,bash]
----
git config --global http.proxy http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxy.server.com:port
----

For more details, see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-httpproxy[Git documentation^].

== Working Offline

You can develop projects using Studio without internet connection. In this case, all project dependencies must already be loaded, that is the project was already opened and assembled by this Studio installation. Some studio features are not available in offline mode, for example, you cannot change the framework version or browse Jmix Add-Ons Marketplace.

To start working offline, open the Gradle tool window on the right side of the IDE and click the *Toggle Offline Mode* button:

In offline mode, Gradle uses dependencies from the cache when executing all project build tasks. Gradle does not attempt to access the network to perform dependency resolution. If the required dependencies are not present in the cache, build execution will fail.

== Non-Standard Studio Builds

Sometimes you might need to use one of the non-standard Studio builds in your IDE, for example, to get early access to the newest Studio features. Using a non-standard Studio build requires installation of a specific plugin version into the IntelliJ IDEA.

NOTE: Pay attention, that non-standard Studio builds have the same subscription requirements as stable releases.

=== Nightly Builds

Nightly Studio builds are published every night as a part of the continuous integration process. These builds contain the latest changes implemented by the Jmix Studio team. You can switch to nightly builds if you want to get the newest features, improvements, and support for upcoming Jmix framework versions.

CAUTION: Nightly builds contain changes that have not passed through the quality assurance process. Therefore, they can contain severe functionality defects.

To use nightly builds, you need to do the followings:

. Open the *Main Menu → File → Settings → Plugins* dialog.
. Click the gear icon and select *Manage Plugin Repositories...*.
+

+
. Click `+` and enter the following path: `\https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/jmix_nightly/list`
+
image::idea-add.png[align="center"]
+
. You should immediately see that Jmix plugin requests for update to the NIGHTLY version.
+
image::jmix-update.png[align="center"]
+
. Click *Update* and restart IDE.

As new nightly builds are published every night, you need to update Jmix plugin on a daily basis to get the latest changes.

If you need to return to the stable plugin version, do the followings:

. Open the *Main Menu → File → Settings → Plugins* dialog.
. Go to the *Installed* tab.
. Uninstall Jmix plugin.
. Click the gear icon and select *Manage Plugin Repositories...*.
. Remove "nightly" repository from the list.
. Install Jmix plugin again, it will come from the stable plugins channel.

=== Install Plugin from Disk

You can download any release of the Studio plugin from the plugin repository site and install it into the IntelliJ IDEA. Follow these steps:

. Open {jmix-plugin-site}[Jmix Plugin page^] in the JetBrains Plugin Repository.
. Select the channel you need to download a release from: Stable or Nightly.
. Find the required build in the *Version History* list and download it.
