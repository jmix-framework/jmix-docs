`EditorScreenFacet` is essentially a xref:facets/screen-facet.adoc[] with an extended set of options for opening entity edit screens.

Component’s XML-name: `editorScreen`.

[[attributes]]
== Attributes

In addition to the xref:facets/screen-facet.adoc#attributes[attributes] of `ScreenFacet`, `EditorScreenFacet` has the following own attributes:

[[add-first]]
* `addFirst` - defines whether a new item will be added to the beginning or the end of the collection. It affects only standalone containers; for nested containers, new items are always added to the end.

[[container]]
* `container` - sets a xref:data/collection-container.adoc[]. The container is updated after the screen is committed. If the container is nested, the framework automatically initializes the reference to the parent entity and sets up data context for editing compositions.

[[edit-mode]]
* `editMode` - sets the screen edit mode, corresponds to the `EditMode` enum:
** `CREATE` - to create a new entity instance.
** `EDIT` - to edit an existing one.

[[entity-class]]
* `entityClass` - the full name of an entity class.

[[field]]
* `field` - sets the xref:vcl/components/entity-picker.adoc[] component id. The framework sets the committed entity to the field after a successful editor commit if the field is set.

[[list-component]]
* `listComponent` - sets the list component id. The component is used to get the container if it is not set. Usually, the list component is a xref:vcl/components/table.adoc[] or xref:vcl/components/data-grid.adoc[] displaying the list of entities.
