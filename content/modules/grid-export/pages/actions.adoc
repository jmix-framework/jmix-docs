= Export Actions

[[export-action]]
== ExportAction

`ExportAction` is a base xref:flow-ui:actions/list-actions.adoc[list action] designed for exporting data grid contents using a specified exporter. An instance of xref:exporters.adoc[DataGridExporter] is required for this action.

This action can be configured for use with both xref:flow-ui:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc[] and xref:flow-ui:vc/components/treeDataGrid.adoc[] components.

Within `ExportAction`, there are methods available for managing functions that extract values from `DataGrid` columns:

* `addColumnValueProvider()` adds a function to retrieve values from a column.
* `removeColumnValueProvider()` removes a column value provider function by column `id`.

[[export-modes]]
=== Export Modes

`ExportAction` has three export modes: all rows, the current page, and selected rows.

* The *All rows* option exports all database records matching the applied filter and the initial query used to populate the view's data.
+
Data loading and export happen in *batches* to optimize performance and manage memory usage. The batch size is configurable via the xref:grid-export:properties.adoc#jmix.gridexport.export-all-batch-size[jmix.gridexport.export-all-batch-size] application property. The default batch size is `1000`.
+
When exporting all records, the default *pagination strategy* is `keyset`. To change this, use the xref:grid-export:properties.adoc#jmix.gridexport.export-all-pagination-strategy[jmix.gridexport.export-all-pagination-strategy] application property.
* The *Current page* option exports only the content displayed on the current page of the data grid.
* The *Selected rows* option export only records selected in the data grid.

The set of export options can be defined by a particular action using its `setAvailableExportModes()` method and corresponding `availableExportModes` property in XML. The default set of options is defined by the xref:properties.adoc#jmix.gridexport.default-export-modes[jmix.gridexport.default-export-modes] application property.

You can override the header and message of the dialog by adding messages with `exportConfirmationDialog.header` and `exportConfirmationDialog.message` keys to your xref:localization:message-bundles.adoc[message bundle].

[[columns-export]]
=== Columns Exporting

You can control which columns are included in the export using three different filtering options:

. *Predefined Column Filter Predicate (Enumeration)*
+
This option allows you to select from a predefined set of filtering behaviors to determine which columns are exported. Configure this using the xref:grid-export:properties.adoc#jmix.gridexport.default-columns-to-export[jmix.gridexport.default-columns-to-export] application property or the `columnsToExport` xref:flow-ui:actions/standard-actions.adoc#additional-properties[additional property] directly on the export action. The available options are:
+
* `ALL_COLUMNS`: Exports all columns, regardless of visibility.
* `VISIBLE_COLUMNS`: Exports only the columns currently visible in the `DataGrid`. Columns marked as visible using the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/gridColumnVisibility.adoc[gridColumnVisibility] component are included in the list of exported columns. This means that hidden columns will be excluded.
+
The default value for new projects is `VISIBLE_COLUMNS`. Existing projects will have their previous export behavior (likely `ALL_COLUMNS`) migrated to the `application.properties` file.
+
Below is an example showing how to configure the export of all columns for a customer `dataGrid`.
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/gridexport-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/customers/customers-view.xml[tags=excelExport]
----
+
NOTE: This method has the lowest priority; more specific methods will override this setting.

. *Flexible Filtering Predicate (Extension Point)*
+
This provides a mechanism for highly customized column selection logic. Create a method annotated with `@Install`, targeting the export action. This method receives a `Grid.Column` object and returns `true` if the column should be exported, `false` otherwise.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/gridexport-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/customers/CustomersView.java[tags=columnsExportFilter]
----
+
include::flow-ui:vc/handler-generation-tip.adoc[]
+
NOTE: This approach has medium priority, meaning it will override the predefined column filter predicate but will be overridden by explicitly specifying column keys.

. *Explicit Column Key Specification (List of Keys)*:
+
This provides the most direct control over which columns are exported. Use the `columnKeysToExport` xref:flow-ui:actions/standard-actions.adoc#additional-properties[additional property] of the export action to define a comma-separated list of column keys to export within the `<action>` definition:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/gridexport-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/customers/customers-view.xml[tags=excel]
----
+
NOTE: This option has the highest priority and will override any other settings.

*Priority Order*. So, the filtering options are processed in this order:

1.  Explicit column key specification.
2.  Flexible filtering predicate.
3.  Predefined column filter predicate.

[[excel-export-action]]
== ExcelExportAction

`ExcelExportAction` is an action extending `ExportAction` and designed to export the data grid content in XLSX format.

The action is implemented by the `io.jmix.gridexportflowui.action.ExcelExportAction` class and should be defined in XML using `type="grdexp_excelExport"` action’s attribute for a list component. Common action parameters can be configured through XML attributes within the `action` element. For more information, refer to the xref:flow-ui:actions/declarative-actions.adoc[Declarative Actions] documentation.

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/gridexport-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/customer/customer-list-view.xml[tags=actions;excelExport]
----

Alternatively, you can inject the action into the view controller and customize its settings using setter methods:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/gridexport-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/customer/CustomerListView.java[tags=excelExport;onInit]
----

You can also override localized data format strings. The default format string settings for Excel export are as follows:

[source,properties]
----
excelExporter.label=Excel
excelExporter.true=Yes
excelExporter.false=No
excelExporter.empty=[Empty]
excelExporter.bytes=<bytes>
excelExporter.timeFormat=h:mm
excelExporter.dateFormat=m/d/yy
excelExporter.dateTimeFormat=m/d/yy h:mm
excelExporter.integerFormat=#,##0
excelExporter.doubleFormat=#,##0.00##############
----

[[json-export-action]]
== JsonExportAction

`JsonExportAction` is an action extending `ExportAction` and designed to export the data grid content in JSON format.

The action is implemented by the `io.jmix.gridexportflowui.action.JsonExportAction` class and should be defined in XML using `type="grdexp_jsonExport"` action’s attribute for a list component. Common action parameters can be configured through XML attributes within the `action` element. For more information, refer to the xref:flow-ui:actions/declarative-actions.adoc[Declarative Actions] documentation.

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/gridexport-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/customer/customer-list-view.xml[tags=actions;jsonExport]
----

Alternatively, you can inject the action into the view controller and customize its settings using setter methods:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/gridexport-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/customer/CustomerListView.java[tags=jsonExport;onInit]
----

[[limatations]]
== Limitations

* When exporting `TreeDataGrid`, the column containing the hierarchy property will not include any padding.
* Exporting entities with a composite primary key is not supported.
