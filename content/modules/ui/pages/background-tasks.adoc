= Background Tasks
:page-aliases: backoffice-ui:background-tasks.adoc

Background tasks mechanism is designed for performing tasks asynchronously without blocking the user interface.

[[basics]]
== Basics
To use background tasks, do the following:

. Define a task as a subclass of the `BackgroundTask` abstract class. Pass the reference to a screen controller associated with the task and the task timeout to the task constructor.
+
Closing the screen will interrupt the tasks associated with it. Additionally, the task will be interrupted automatically after the specified timeout.

. Implement the task in the `BackgroundTask.run()` method.

. Create an object of `BackgroundTaskHandler` class controlling the task by passing the task instance to the `handle()` method of the `BackgroundWorker` bean. You can obtain a reference to `BackgroundWorker` by injection in the screen controller or via `ApplicationContext`.

. Run the task by invoking the `execute()` method of `BackgroundTaskHandler`.

[WARNING]
Do not read or update the state of UI components and data containers in `BackgroundTask.run()` method; use `done()`, `progress()`, and `canceled()` callback methods instead. If you try to set a value to a UI component from a background thread, `IllegalConcurrentAccessException` is thrown.

Below is an example of running a background task and tracking its progress using the `ProgressBar` component:

<1> A task that takes time to complete. The `run()` method is executed in a separate thread.
<2> The `progress()` method is executed in the UI thread, so we can update visual components here.

== BackgroundTask Class

`BackgroundTask<T, V>` is a parameterized class:

1. `T` − the type of objects displaying task progress. Objects of this type are passed to the task’s `progress()` method during an invocation of `TaskLifeCycle.publish()` in the working thread.

2. `V` − task result type passed to the `done()` method. You can also obtain the result by invoking `BackgroundTaskHandler.getResult()` method, which will wait for a task to complete.

`BackgroundTask` objects are stateless. If you don't create fields for temporary data when implementing task class, you can start several parallel processes using a single task instance.

[[background-task-methods]]
== BackgroundTask Methods

Detailed information about methods is provided in Javadocs for `BackgroundTask`, `TaskLifeCycle`, `BackgroundTaskHandler` classes.

[[run]]
=== run()

This method is invoked in a separate working thread to perform a task.

The method should support external interruptions. To ensure this, check the `TaskLifeCycle.isInterrupted()` flag periodically during long processes and stop execution when needed. Additionally, you should not silently discard `InterruptedException` (or any other exception) - instead, you should either exit the method correctly or not handle the exception at all.

You can also check whether the task was interrupted by the `cancel()` method or not, using the `isCancelled()` method.

[[canceled]]
=== canceled()

This method is invoked in UI thread only during a controlled cancellation of a task, for example, when the `cancel()` method is invoked in the `TaskHandler`.

[[progress]]
=== progress()

This method is invoked in UI thread when the progress value change. For example, after calling the `taskLifeCycle.publish()` method.

[[done]]
=== done()

This method is invoked in UI thread when the task is completed.

[[handle-timeout-exception]]
=== handleTimeoutException()

This method is invoked in UI thread when the task timeout expires. If the window where the task is running closes, the task is stopped without notification.

[[handle-exception]]
=== handleException()

This method is invoked in UI thread when any exceptions occur.

[[notes-and-tips]]
== Notes & Tips

1. Use `dialogs.createBackgroundWorkDialog()` method to show a modal window with a progress indicator and *Cancel* button. You can define progress indication type and allow or prohibit the cancellation of the background task for the window.

//todo BackgroundTaskWrapper
// Ни Глеб, ни Роман не знают каким классом был заменен BackgroundTaskWrapper. Сказали уточнить у Влада, но он пока что в отпуске. Как выйдет надо будет поправить и сделать usage example.
// 2. `BackgroundHandler` object `execute()` method can only be started once. If you need to restart a task frequently, use `BackgroundTaskWrapper` class.
+
2. If you need to use certain values of visual components in the task thread, you should implement their acquisition in the `getParams()` method, which runs in the UI thread once a task starts. In the `run()` method, these parameters will be accessible via the `getParams()` method of the `TaskLifeCycle` object.
3. Background tasks are affected by xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.background-task-timeout-check-interval[jmix.ui.background-task-timeout-check-interval] and xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.background-task.threads-count[jmix.ui.background-task.threads-count] application properties.

[[usage-example]]
== Usage Example

Often, when launching a background task, you need to display a simple user interface:

1. To show to the user that the requested action is in the process of execution.
2. To allow the user to abort the requested long operation.
3. To show operation progress if progress percent can be determined.

You can do it using the `createBackgroundWorkDialog()` method of the xref:dialogs.adoc[Dialogs] interface.

Consider the following development task as an example:

1. A given screen contains a table displaying a list of customers, with multi-selection enabled.
2. When the user presses a button, the system should send reminder emails to selected customers, without blocking UI and with the ability to cancel the operation.

----
<1> Launch the task, show progress dialog, and set its options:
- dialog caption;
- dialog message;
- total number of elements for progress bar;
- show progress in percent or not;
- show *Cancel* button or not.
<2> Task progress unit is `Integer` - the number of processed table items, and result type is `Void` because this task doesn't return a result.
<3> Selected table items are saved into a variable that is initialized in the task constructor. This is necessary because the `run()` method is executed in a background thread and cannot access UI components.
<4> Set timeout to 10 minutes.
<5> Periodically check `isCancelled()` to stop the task immediately after pressing the *Cancel* dialog button.
<6> Send email. See more about email sending xref:email:index.adoc[here].
<7> Update progress bar position after every email sent.
