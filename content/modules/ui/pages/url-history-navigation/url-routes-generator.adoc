Sometimes, it is necessary to get a proper URL of some application screen that can be sent via email or shown to the user. The simplest way to generate it is by using the URL Routes Generator.

URL Routes Generator provides API for generating links to an entity editor screen or a screen defined by its id or class. The link can also contain URL parameters that enable to reflect inner screen state to URL to use it later.

The `getRouteGenerator()` method of `UrlRouting` bean allows you to get an instance of `RouteGenerator`. `RouteGenerator` has the following methods:

* `getRoute(String screenId)` - returns a route for a screen with the given `screenId`, for example:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/urlhistorynav/UrlRoutesGeneratorScreen.java[tags=get-route-by-screen-id]
----
+
The resulting URL will be like `++http://host:port/#main/customers++`

* `getRoute(Class<? extends Screen> screenClass)` - generates a route for a screen with the given `screenClass`, for example:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/urlhistorynav/UrlRoutesGeneratorScreen.java[tags=get-route-by-screen-class]
----
+
The resulting URL will be like `++http://host:port/#main/customers++`

* `getEditorRoute(Object entity)` - generates a route to a default editor screen of the given entity, for example:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/urlhistorynav/UrlRoutesGeneratorScreen.java[tags=get-editor-route]
----
+
The resulting URL will be like `++http://host:port/#main/customers/edit?id=5jqtc3pwzx6g6mq1vv5gkyjn0s++`

* `getEditorRoute(Object entity, Class<? extends Screen> screenClass)` - generates a route for an editor with the given `screenClass` and `entity`.

* `getRoute(Class<? extends Screen> screenClass, Map<String, String> urlParams)` - generates a route for a screen with the given `screenClass` and `urlParams`.

== URL Routes Generator Example

Suppose we have a `Customer` entity with standard screens that have registered routes. Let’s add a button to the browser screen that generates a link to the editor of the selected entity:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/entity/customer/CustomerBrowse.java[tags=inject-url-routing;inject-dialogs;get-editor-route]
----

The resulting route looks like this:
