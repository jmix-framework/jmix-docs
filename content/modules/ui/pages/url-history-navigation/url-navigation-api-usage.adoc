= Using URL History and Navigation API
:page-aliases: backoffice-ui:url-history-navigation/url-navigation-api-usage.adoc

This section contains examples of using the URL History and Navigation API.

Suppose we have an `Event` entity and `EventInfo` screen with information about a selected event.

The `EventInfo` screen controller contains the `@Route` annotation to specify the route to the screen:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/urlhistorynav/EventInfo.java[tags=event-info;event-info-start;event-info-end]
----

As a result, a user can open the screen by entering `++http://localhost:8081/#main/event-info++` in the address bar:

When the screen is open, the address also contains a state mark.

[[mapping-state-to-url]]
== Mapping State to URL

Suppose that the `EventInfo` screen shows information about a single event at a time, and it has controls to switch the selected events. You may want to reflect the currently viewed event in the URL to copy the URL and later open the screen for this particular event just by pasting the URL to the address bar.

The following code implements mapping of the selected event to the URL:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/urlhistorynav/EventInfo.java[tags=event-info;event-info-start;inject-event-field;inject-url-routing;select-btn;event-info-end]
----

<1> Get the current event from `EntityComboBox`.
<2> Remove URL parameters if no event is selected.
<3> Serialize event’s `id` with the `UrlIdSerializer` helper.
<4> Replace the current URL state with the new one containing serialized event `id` as a parameter.

As a result, the application URL is changed when the user selects an event and clicks the *Select Event* button:

[[url-params-changed-event]]
== UrlParamsChangedEvent

Now let’s implement the last requirement: when a user enters the URL with the route and the `event_id` parameter, the application must show the screen with the corresponding event selected.

Below is an example of subscribing to the `UrlParamsChangedEvent` in the screen controller code:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/urlhistorynav/EventInfo.java[tags=url-params-changed-event]
----

<1> Get the parameter value from `UrlParamsChangedEvent`.
<2> Deserialize the event `id`.
<3> Load the event instance and set it to the field.
