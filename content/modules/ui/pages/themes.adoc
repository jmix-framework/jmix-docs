Themes are used to manage the visual presentation of the application.

A theme consists of https://sass-lang.com/[SCSS^] files and other resources like images.

Jmix provides xref:themes/theme_usage.adoc[built-in compiled themes] for convenience and demo purposes. You can create a xref:themes/custom_theme.adoc[custom theme] based on a built-in one directly in your project. To provide a theme that can be used in different projects, create a xref:themes/theme_addon.adoc[theme add-on].
