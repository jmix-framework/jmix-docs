[[auto]]
To enable presentation for all tables on the screen, you can set the `auto` attribute to `true`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/facets/presentationsfacet/presentations-facet-screen.xml[tags=facets-start;auto;facets-end]
----

If you have specific components to enable presentations, you can configure your facet like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/facets/presentationsfacet/presentations-facet-screen.xml[tags=facets-start;manual;facets-end;layout]
