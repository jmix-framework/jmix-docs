The `Filter` component is a versatile tool for filtering the data it is bound to.

The component enables <<quick-filtering,quick data filtering>> by arbitrary conditions, as well as creating <<configuration,configurations>> for repeated use.

Component’s XML-name: `filter`.

== Basics

`Filter` should be connected to a data loader of a standalone `CollectionContainer` or `KeyValueCollectionContainer`. It generates a `Condition` object that is set to the loader and later processed by the xref:data-model:data-stores.adoc[data store]. For a xref:data-model:entities.adoc#jpa[JPA entity], the data store modifies the resulting JPQL query, so the filtering is done on the database level, and only selected data is loaded from the database to the application memory.

By default, Jmix Studio generates the `Filter` component when creating browser and master-detail screens for an entity.

An example of `filter` declaration in the XML screen descriptor is shown below:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=data-start;customersDc;data-end;layout-start;filter;customersTable;layout-end]
----

In the example above, the data container holds the collection of `Customer` entity instances. The data loader loads the collection using a JPQL query. The `filter` component is connected to the loader using the `dataLoader` attribute. Data is displayed using the `Table` component, which is connected to the data container.

A typical filter is shown below:

image::vcl/components/filter-anatomy.png[align="center"]

[[add-condition-link]]
* The *Add search condition* link (1).

[[refresh-drop-down-menu]]
* The drop-down menu with the saved filters and configurations (2).

[[refresh-button]]
* The *Refresh* button with the drop-down menu (3).

[[operation-selector]]
* The operation selector (4).

[[condition-fields]]
* The condition value field (5).

[[filter-settings-button]]
* The filter settings popup button (6).

[[quick-filtering]]
By default, the component is in quick filter mode. It means that a user can add a set of conditions for a one-off data search. After the screen is closed, the conditions will disappear.

[[quick-filter-example]]
== Quick Filter Example

Let’s consider that we have the `Customer` entity and want to:

* Create a quick filter with multiple conditions in the *Customer browser* screen.
* Save this filter for the future.

=== Creating a Quick Filter

* Click the *Add search condition* link(<<add-condition-link,1>>).
* Select the *Age* property in the *Properties* list.
* Select the *Hobby* property.
+
Selected conditions are displayed at the top of the filter panel.
* Modify the condition value fields and operations:

image::vcl/components/filter-sample.png[align="center"]

=== Saving the Filter

* Click the filter settings icon(<<filter-settings-button,6>>), select *Save with values*.
* Provide a new filter configuration name in the *Save filter configuration* dialog:
+
image::vcl/components/filter-sample-save.png[align="center"]

After that, the filter will be saved and appear in the *Refresh* button's drop-down menu(<<refresh-button,3>>).

image::vcl/components/filter-sample-refresh.png[align="center"]

The *Reset filter* menu lets you reset all currently applied search conditions.

[[add-condition]]
== Adding Conditions

To create a quick filter, click the *Add search condition* link (<<add-condition-link,1>>). The *Add condition* screen will be displayed:

image::vcl/components/filter-add-condition.png[align="center"]

Possible condition types are described below:

* *Properties* - attributes of this entity and related entities. Only persistent attributes are displayed. They are displayed according to the rules specified in the <<filter-element-properties,properties>> element.

[[predefined-conditions]]
* *Predefined conditions* are conditions specified by the developer in the <<filter-element-conditions,conditions>> element in the XML descriptor. Predefined conditions are not initially added to any configurations, but the user can select them in the *Add Condition* screen and add to the <<run-time-configuration,run-time configuration>>.

* *Configurations* can be created at design-time or run-time (via the <<configuration,Configuration editor>>).

Selected conditions are displayed at the top of the filter panel. The image:vcl/components/filter-remove-condition.png[] icon will appear next to each condition field, allowing them to be removed from the set.

[[registered-filters-popup-button]]
The drop-down actions of the *Create* button correspond to the xref:vcl/components/filter-components.adoc#filter-component-registration[registered] filter components. Three filter components named `PropertyFilter`, `JpqlFilter`, and `GroupFilter` are available by default:

* `PropertyFilter` corresponds to <<property-conditions,property conditions>>.
* `JpqlFilter` corresponds to <<jpql-conditions,JPQL conditions>>.
* `GroupFilter` corresponds to <<group-conditions,group conditions>>.

image::vcl/components/filter-create-filter-button.png[align="center"]

When the xref:search:index.adoc[Search] add-on is added to the project, a new xref:search:search-in-ui.adoc#fts-condition-in-filter-component[Full-text condition] is available for usage.

So the user has the opportunity to create filter conditions in run-time.

[[property-conditions]]
=== Property Conditions

The *Property conditions editor* allows users to configure the attributes of the xref:vcl/components/property-filter.adoc[PropertyFilter] component. `PropertyFilter` is related to the entity property.

image::vcl/components/filter-property-conditions.png[align="center"]

Select the entity attribute in the *Property* field.

The *Operation* field enables selecting the condition xref:vcl/components/property-filter.adoc#operation[operator]. The list of available operations depends on the attribute type.

Use the *Parameter name* attribute to set the name of the associated query parameter name. You can use this name to introduce dependencies between filter components in configuration. If not defined, then the parameter name is randomly generated.

You can set the custom caption of the property filter condition in the *Caption* field.

Use the *Operation editable* checkbox to set whether an operation selector is visible. If you select this checkbox, the operation field enables selecting the condition operator in run-time.

Use the *Operation caption visible* checkbox to define the visibility of the operation caption.

You can set the default value for the filter condition in the *Default value* field.

[[jpql-conditions]]
=== JPQL Conditions

The *JPQL conditions editor* allows users to create conditions based on JPQL expressions.

image::vcl/components/filter-jpql-conditions.png[align="center"]

In the *Parameter type* field, you should select the Java class of the condition parameter. The `No parameter` value lets you create a condition without parameters. For example:

image::vcl/components/filter-jpql-conditions-no-parameters.png[align="center"]

The *Caption* field is required. You should set the condition name displayed in the filter.

Use the *Parameter name* attribute to set the name of the associated query parameter. You can use this name to introduce dependencies between filter components in configuration. If not defined, then the parameter name is randomly generated.

Use the *Has IN expression* checkbox to define whether JPQL expression should contain `IN` expression. In this case, the application will use the xref:vcl/components/values-picker.adoc[ValuesPicker] component for creating the list of condition values.

You can set the default value for the filter condition in the *Default value* field.

[[jpql-conditions-join]]
In the *Join* field, you can specify JPQL expression, which will be added to the `from` data loader query section. This can be required to create a complex condition based on an attribute of a related collection. The expression should be started with `join` or `left join` statements. The `\{E}` placeholder should be used in the expression instead of the alias of the entity being selected.

image::vcl/components/filter-jpql-conditions-join.png[align="center"]

[[jpql-conditions-where]]
The value in the *Where* field specifies the JPQL expression, which will be added to the `where` data loader query section. The `\{E}` placeholder should be used in the expression instead of the alias of the entity being selected. The condition can only have one parameter denoted by `?` if used.

[[group-conditions]]
=== Group Conditions

The *Group conditions editor* allows users to combine several conditions into a logical group.

image::vcl/components/filter-group-conditions.png[align="center"]

The *Operation* drop-down allows users to select a logical group operator.

The *Caption* field is required. You should set the condition name displayed in the filter.

Use the *Operation caption visible* checkbox to define the visibility of the operation caption.

To add a condition, click the *Add* button. The <<add-condition,Add condition>> screen will be displayed.

The filter conditions are contained in the tree. Users can determine the order of filter conditions in a filter using the image:vcl/components/filter-group-conditions-move-down.png[align="center"]/image:vcl/components/filter-group-conditions-move-up.png[align="center"] buttons and remove and edit conditions using the *Remove* and *Edit* buttons.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

A configuration is a set of filter components.

`LogicalFilterComponent` is the root element of the configuration.

The configuration does not store a reference to all components but stores a reference only to the root element, from which the rest filter components can be obtained.

Configurations can be created at design-time or run-time (via the <<run-time-configuration,Configuration editor>> screen).

[[design-time-configuration]]
=== Design-time Configuration

Design-time configuration cannot be changed and saved in run-time. Still, the user can use the `Copy` action that copies all conditions from the design-time configuration to the run-time configuration.

All design-time configurations are displayed in the drop-down menu(<<refresh-drop-down-menu,2>>) with the saved filters and configurations:

image::vcl/components/filter-design-time-configuration.png[align="center"]

An example of `filter` with design-time configurations in the XML screen descriptor is shown below:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter-design-time-configuration]
----

`id` is a required attribute and must be unique within this filter. If the `name` attribute is not specified, then `id` is used as a key in the xref:localization:message-bundles.adoc[message bundle].

[[design-time-configuration-default]]
Use the `default` XML attribute to set the design-time configuration as default for filter. So it appears right after opening the screen.

[[run-time-configuration]]
=== Run-time Configuration

To create, edit or remove configurations in run-time, a user should have <<ui-filter-modifyConfiguration,ui.filter.modifyConfiguration>> security permission.

To open the *Configuration editor* screen, use the *Edit* action in the Settings(<<filter-settings-button,6>>) popup button.

image::vcl/components/filter-run-time-configuration.png[align="center"]

The *Configuration name* field is required. You should set the configuration name displayed in the drop-down menu(<<refresh-drop-down-menu,2>>) with the saved filters and configurations.

[[available-for-all-users]]
You can set filter available to all users using the *Available for all users* checkbox. This checkbox is only available to users having the specific <<ui-filter-modifyGlobalConfiguration,ui.filter.modifyGlobalConfiguration>> permission.

[[default-for-all-users]]
Use the *Default for all users* checkbox to set whether the created configuration will be automatically selected when users open the screen. This checkbox is enabled if the *Available for all users* checkbox is selected.

The other *Configuration editor* fields are described in <<group-conditions,Group Conditions>>.

[[filter-elements]]
== Filter Elements

`filter` defined in the XML descriptor may contain nested elements. They describe conditions available for user selection in the *Add Condition* dialog:

[[filter-element-properties]]
=== properties

The `properties` element allows you to make multiple entity attributes available for selection. This element has the following attributes:

[[filter-element-properties-include]]
* `include` is a required attribute. It contains a regular expression, which should match an entity attribute name.

[[filter-element-properties-exclude]]
* `exclude` - contains a regular expression. If an attribute matches the expression, it will be excluded from previously included (using `include`).
* `excludeProperties` - contains a comma-separated list of property paths that should be excluded from filtering. As opposed to exclude, it supports traversing the entity graphs, for example, `customer.name`.
* `excludeRecursively` - defines if an attribute from `excludeProperties` should be excluded recursively for the whole object graph. If `true`, an attribute and all its nested attributes with the same name will be excluded.

In the example below, we declare a `filter` component with the `properties` nested element:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter-with-properties]
----

The following entity attributes are ignored when the `properties` element is used:

* Not accessible due to the xref:security:index.adoc[security] permissions.
* Collections (`@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`).
* Non-persistent attributes.
* Attributes annotated with `@SystemLevel`.
* Attributes of type `byte[]`.

[[filter-element-conditions]]
=== conditions

The `conditions` element is used to create <<predefined-conditions,predefined conditions>>.

In the example below, we declare a `filter` component with the `conditions` nested element:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter-with-conditions]
----

The `conditions` element may contain any number of xref:vcl/components/filter-components.adoc#property-filter[propertyFilter], xref:vcl/components/filter-components.adoc#jpql-filter[jpqlFilter] or xref:vcl/components/filter-components.adoc#group-filter[groupFilter].

[[filter-element-configurations]]
=== configurations

The `configurations` element is used to create <<design-time-configuration,design-time configurations>>.

[[filter-element-actions]]
=== actions

`actions` - an optional element to define the list of actions for filter management.

[[filter-default-actions]]
The framework provides the following default actions in the filter settings popup button(<<filter-settings-button,6>>) image:vcl/components/filter-settings-popup.png[align="center"]:

[[filter-save-action]]
* *Save* - implemented by `FilterSaveAction` (`type="filter_save"` in XML) which saves changes to the current filter configuration.

[[filter-save-with-values-action]]
* *Save with values* - implemented by `FilterSaveWithValuesAction` (`type="filter_saveWithValues"` in XML) which saves changes to the current filter using the values in the condition fields(<<condition-fields,5>>) as the filter default values.

[[filter-save-as-action]]
* *Save as* - implemented by `FilterSaveAsAction` (`type="filter_saveAs"` in XML) which saves the filter configuration under a new name.

[[filter-edit-action]]
* *Edit* - implemented by `FilterEditAction` (`type="filter_edit"` in XML) which edits the current <<run-time-configuration,run-time filter configuration>> (opens the *Configuration editor* screen). Disabled for <<design-time-configuration,design-time configurations>>.

[[filter-remove-action]]
* *Remove* - implemented by `FilterRemoveAction` (`type="filter_remove"` in XML) which removes the current run-time filter configuration. Disabled for design-time configurations.

[[filter-make-default-action]]
* *Make default* - implemented by `FilterMakeDefaultAction` (`type="filter_makeDefault"` in XML) which makes the filter configuration default for this screen. The filter will be automatically displayed on the filter panel when the screen is opened. Takes precedence over the <<design-time-configuration-default,default>> attribute of design-time configuration and the <<default-for-all-users,Default for all users>> checkbox of run-time configuration. It is disabled if no `screenSettings` facet is added to the screen.

[[filter-copy-action]]
* *Copy* - implemented by `FilterCopyAction` (`type="filter_copy"` in XML) which copies all conditions from the design-time configuration to the run-time configuration.

[[filter-clear-values-action]]
* *Clear values* - implemented by `FilterClearValuesAction` (`type="filter_clearValues"` in XML) which clears the filter condition values(<<condition-fields,5>>).

[[filter-add-condition-action]]
* *Add* implemented by `FilterAddConditionAction` (`type="filter_addCondition"` in XML) which adds a condition to the current filter configuration.

Users can override <<filter-default-actions,default>> actions using the `actions` nested element. For example:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter-with-actions]
----

You can configure common action parameters using XML attributes of the `action` element, see xref:actions.adoc[Actions] for details.

[[filter-attributes]]
== Filter Attributes

[[filter-attribute-auto-apply]]
=== autoApply

The `autoApply` attribute specifies when the filter is applied. If the attribute value is `false`, filter will be applied only after the *Refresh* button is clicked. If the attribute value is `true`, filter is applied immediately after changing the filter components. The default value is specified in the xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-auto-apply[jmix.ui.component.filter-auto-apply] property.

[[filter-attribute-columns-count]]
=== columnsCount
The `columnsCount` sets the number of columns to be displayed on one row. The default value is specified in the xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-columns-count[jmix.ui.component.filter-columns-count] property.

[[filter-attribute-caption-position]]
=== captionPosition

The `captionPosition` attribute defines the caption position of filter child components: `TOP` or `LEFT`. The default value is `LEFT`.

[[permissions]]
== Permissions

Advanced filter management requires special permissions:

[[ui-filter-modifyConfiguration]]
* To create/change/delete filter <<configuration,configurations>>, users must have the
`ui.filter.modifyConfiguration` specific permission.

[[ui-filter-modifyGlobalConfiguration]]
* To create/change/delete global (<<available-for-all-users,available for all users>>) filter configurations, users must have the `ui.filter.modifyGlobalConfiguration` specific permission.

[[ui-filter-modifyJpqlCondition]]
* To create/change <<jpql-conditions,JPQL conditions>> in run-time, users must have the `ui.filter.modifyJpqlCondition` specific permission.

You can either give users the *UI: edit filters* predefined resource role, or configure the necessary permissions in your own xref:security:resource-roles.adoc#create[role].

[[app-properties]]
== Application Properties

The following application properties affect the filter behavior:

* xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-auto-apply[jmix.ui.component.filter-auto-apply];
* xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-columns-count[jmix.ui.component.filter-columns-count];
* xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-properties-hierarchy-depth[jmix.ui.component.filter-properties-hierarchy-depth];
* xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.filter-show-configuration-id-field[jmix.ui.component.filter-show-configuration-id-field].

[[creating-filter-programmatically]]
== Creating Filter Programmatically

In the example below, we will create the `Filter` component with a <<design-time-configuration,design-time configuration>> and add this filter to the tab, defined in the XML descriptor.

To create the `Filter` component in the controller, use the `UiComponents` factory.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/FilterScreen.java[tags=inject-ui-components;inject-single-filter-support;inject-customers-dl;on-after-init-start;filter-creating;on-after-init-end]
----

<1> Creates `Filter` and sets its properties.
<2> Adds a design-time configuration with the `javaDefaultConfiguration` id and the `Default configuration` name.
<3> Creates `PropertyFilter` and sets its properties.
<4> Generates the filter value component by the given metaClass, entity property and operation.
<5> Adds the created property filter to the `javaDefaultConfiguration` configuration.
<6> Sets the `javaDefaultConfiguration` configuration as current.
<7> Gets the tab by its `id`.
<8> Adds the created `Filter` component to the `programmaticFilterTab` tab.

[[handlers]]
== Events and Handlers

include::../events-hanlers-generation-tip.adoc[]

[[context-help-icon-click-handler]]
=== ContextHelpIconClickHandler

See xref:vcl/api.adoc#context-help-icon-click-handler[ContextHelpIconClickHandler].

[[expanded-state-change-event]]
=== ExpandedStateChangeEvent

See xref:vcl/api.adoc#expanded-state-change-event[ExpandedStateChangeEvent].

[[configuration-change-event]]
=== ConfigurationChangeEvent

ConfigurationChangeEvent is sent when the <<configuration,configuration>> is changed. Example of subscribing to the event for `filter` defined in the screen XML with the `filter` id:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/FilterScreen.java[tags=configuration-change-event]
----

To register the event handler programmatically, use the `addConfigurationChangeListener()` component method.

[[properties-filter-predicate]]
=== PropertiesFilterPredicate

To <<filter-element-properties-include,include>> or <<filter-element-properties-exclude,exclude>> properties programmatically, use the `PropertiesFilterPredicate`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/FilterScreen.java[tags=properties-filter-predicate]
----

This predicate is added to the current properties filter predicate and tests whether a property with the given path should be available for filtering.

To add a predicate programmatically, use the `addPropertiesFilterPredicate()` component method. The resulting predicate is a composed predicate that represents a short-circuiting logical AND of given predicate and current properties filter predicate.
