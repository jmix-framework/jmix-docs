:page-aliases: backoffice-ui:vcl/components/file-storage-upload-field.adoc

`FileStorageUploadField` component allows you to upload a file to the xref:files:index.adoc[file storage] and link it to an entity attribute as a `FileRef` object.

The component can contain a caption, a link to the uploaded file, and an upload button. When the upload button is clicked, a standard OS file picker window is shown, where the user can select a file.

[[basics]]
== Basics

In the example below, `image` attribute of the `Person` entity has the `FileRef` type.

----

To store a file in an entity attribute as a byte array instead of `FileRef`, use the xref:vcl/components/file-upload-field.adoc[FileUploadField] component.

//todo add link to FileStorage
The uploaded file will be immediately stored in the default FileStorage. To control the saving of the file programmatically, use the <<file-storage-put-mode,fileStoragePutMode>> attribute.

[[listeners]]
== Listeners

You can track the upload process with the following listeners:

[[after-value-clear-listener]]
* `AfterValueClearListener` - invoked after the value has been cleared using the clear button.

[[before-value-clear-listener]]
* `BeforeValueClearListener` - invoked when you click on the clear button.

[[file-upload-error-listener]]
* `FileUploadErrorListener` -  invoked when the upload is finished, but unsuccessful.

[[file-upload-finish-listener]]
* `FileUploadFinishListener` - invoked when the file is uploaded.

[[file-upload-start-listener]]
* `FileUploadStartListener` - invoked when start uploading the file.

[[file-upload-succeed-listener]]
* `FileUploadSucceedListener` - invoked when the upload is successfully finished.

[[value-change-listener]]
* `ValueChangeListener` - invoked when the value of the field is changed.

[[attributes]]
== Attributes

[[file-storage-put-mode]]
=== fileStoragePutMode

By default, the `fileStoragePutMode` attribute is set to `IMMEDIATE` value. You can control the saving of the file programmatically if you set the `fileStoragePutMode` attribute to the `MANUAL` value:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filestorageuploadfield/file-storage-upload-field-screen.xml[tags=manually-controlled]
----

In the screen controller, define the component itself, and the `TemporaryStorage` interface. Then subscribe to the <<listeners, events>> of successful uploads or error:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/filestorageuploadfield/FileStorageUploadFieldScreen.java[tags=manually]
----

<1> Here you can get the file uploaded to the temporary storage if you need it.
<2> Do what you want with the file here.
<3>	Save file to FileStorage.

The component will upload the file to the temporary storage and invoke the `FileUploadSucceedEvent` listener.

//todo add link to FileStorage
`TemporaryStorage.putFileIntoStorage()` method moves the uploaded file from the temporary client storage to FileStorage. Parameters of this method are file identifier and file name. Both of these parameters are provided by `FileStorageUploadField`.

[[file-storage]]
=== fileStorage

The `fileStorage` attribute allows you to specify the name of a `FileStorage` where the uploaded file will be placed.

[[drop-zone]]
=== dropZone

//todo add link to box layout
The `dropZone` attribute allows you to specify a `BoxLayout` to be used as a target for drag-and-dropping files from outside of the browser. The `dropZone` can cover the whole layout of a dialog window. The selected container is highlighted when a user drags a file over the container, otherwise, it is not visible.

----

image::vcl/components/dynamic-file-storage-upload-field.png[align="center"]

To make a `dropZone` static and display it permanently, assign the predefined `dropzone-container` style to its container. In this case, the container should be empty with only the label component inside:

[[drop-zone-prompt]]
=== dropZonePrompt

The `dropZonePrompt` attribute allows you to set the text that will be shown on drag over the window with a file.

----

[[paste-zone]]
=== pasteZone

The `pasteZone` attribute allows you to specify a container to be used for handling paste shortcuts when a text input field nested in this container is focused. To do this, set the `pasteZone` attribute to the container id value. This feature is supported by Chromium-based browsers.

[[file-size-limit]]
=== fileSizeLimit

Maximum upload size is determined by the xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix-ui-component-upload-field-max-upload-size-mb[jmix.ui.component.uploadFieldMaxUploadSizeMb] application property and equals 20MB by default. If you select a file of a larger size, a corresponding message will be displayed, and the upload will be interrupted. To change the maximum upload size for concrete `fileStorageUploadField` use the `fileSizeLimit` attribute, which allows you to set the maximum allowed file size specified in bytes.
